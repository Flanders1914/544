  "description": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.\nThe algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n\nWhitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (\" \").\nSignedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.\nConversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.\nRounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.\n\nReturn the integer as the final result.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation:\n\nThe underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \" -042\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"   -042\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -042\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -042\" (\"042\" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)\n               ^\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"1337c0d3\"\nOutput: 1337\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"1337c0d3\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"1337c0d3\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"1337c0d3\" (\"1337\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: s = \"0-1\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"0-1\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"0-1\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"0-1\" (\"0\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n          ^\n\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: s = \"words and 987\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nReading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length <= 200\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.\n\n",
