  "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: citations = [1,3,1]\nOutput: 1\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == citations.length\n1 <= n <= 5000\n0 <= citations[i] <= 1000\n\n",
