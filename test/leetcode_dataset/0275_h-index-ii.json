  "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: citations = [1,2,100]\nOutput: 2\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == citations.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n0 <= citations[i] <= 1000\ncitations is sorted in ascending order.\n\n",
