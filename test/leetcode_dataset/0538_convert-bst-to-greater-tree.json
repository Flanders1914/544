  "description": "Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.\nAs a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:\n\nThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\nThe right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\nBoth the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]\nOutput: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [0,null,1]\nOutput: [1,null,1]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-104 <= Node.val <= 104\nAll the values in the tree are unique.\nroot is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.\n\n \nNote: This question is the same as 1038: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/\n",
