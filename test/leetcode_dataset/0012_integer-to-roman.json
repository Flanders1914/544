  "description": "Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:\n\n\n\nSymbol\nValue\n\n\n\n\nI\n1\n\n\nV\n5\n\n\nX\n10\n\n\nL\n50\n\n\nC\n100\n\n\nD\n500\n\n\nM\n1000\n\n\n\nRoman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:\n\nIf the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.\nIf the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).\nOnly powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.\n\nGiven an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = 3749\nOutput: \"MMMDCCXLIX\"\nExplanation:\n\n3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)\n 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)\n  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)\n   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)\nNote: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = 58\nOutput: \"LVIII\"\nExplanation:\n\n50 = L\n 8 = VIII\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: num = 1994\nOutput: \"MCMXCIV\"\nExplanation:\n\n1000 = M\n 900 = CM\n  90 = XC\n   4 = IV\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= num <= 3999\n\n",
