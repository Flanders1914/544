    "explanation": "The solution constructs Pascal's triangle row by row. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We start with an empty list `triangle` to hold the rows of Pascal's triangle.\n2. **Outer Loop**: We iterate from `0` to `numRows - 1` to create each row.\n3. **Row Creation**: For each row, we initialize it with `1`s. The length of the row is `row_num + 1` because the first row has 1 element, the second has 2, and so on.\n4. **Inner Loop**: For rows greater than the first and second, we calculate the values in between the `1`s. Each value is computed as the sum of the two values directly above it from the previous row.\n5. **Appending Rows**: After constructing each row, we append it to the `triangle`.\n6. **Return**: Finally, we return the complete triangle.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is `numRows`, because we are generating each row and each row has a number of elements proportional to its index.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the storage of the triangle in a list of lists.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs Pascal's triangle up to the specified number of rows."
