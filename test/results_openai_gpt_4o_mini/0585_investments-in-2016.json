It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.\nlon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.\n\n \nWrite a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:\n\nhave the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and\nare not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).\n\nRound tiv_2016 to two decimal places.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nInsurance table:\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\n| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\n| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |\n| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |\n| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |\n| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\nOutput: \n+----------+\n| tiv_2016 |\n+----------+\n| 45.00    |\n+----------+\nExplanation: \nThe first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.\nThe tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.\n\nThe second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.\nSo, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution involves using the Pandas library to manipulate the data in a DataFrame format. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Grouping by `tiv_2015`**: We use `groupby` and `filter` to find all `tiv_2015` values that are shared by more than one policyholder. This gives us a DataFrame of policyholders who meet the first criterion.\n\n2. **Identifying Unique Locations**: We again use `groupby` and `filter` to find `(lat, lon)` pairs that are unique (i.e., appear only once). This gives us another DataFrame of policyholders who meet the second criterion.\n\n3. **Combining Results**: We then filter the unique locations DataFrame to include only those policyholders whose `tiv_2015` values are in the previously identified shared values.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total**: Finally, we sum the `tiv_2016` values of the valid policyholders and round the result to two decimal places.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of policyholders, as we are essentially making a few passes over the data.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of intermediate DataFrames.\n\nThis approach efficiently identifies the required policyholders and computes the desired sum."
