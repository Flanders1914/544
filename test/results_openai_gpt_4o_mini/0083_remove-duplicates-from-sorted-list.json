    "explanation": "The provided solution defines a method `deleteDuplicates` that takes the head of a sorted linked list as input and returns the head of the modified list with duplicates removed. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by setting a pointer `current` to the head of the list.\n2. **Traversal**: We enter a while loop that continues as long as `current` and `current.next` are not `None`. This ensures we do not go out of bounds.\n3. **Duplicate Check**: Inside the loop, we check if the value of the current node is equal to the value of the next node. If they are equal, it indicates a duplicate, and we adjust the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the duplicate node.\n4. **Move Forward**: If the values are not equal, we simply move the `current` pointer to the next node.\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the head of the modified list.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we traverse the list once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are modifying the list in place without using any extra space.\n\nThis solution efficiently removes duplicates while maintaining the order of the linked list."
