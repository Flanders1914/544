    "description": "You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.\nReconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]\nOutput: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]\nExplanation:\nPerson 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.\nPerson 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.\nPerson 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.\nPerson 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.\nPerson 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.\nPerson 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.\nHence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]\nOutput: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= people.length <= 2000\n0 <= hi <= 106\n0 <= ki < people.length\nIt is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.\n\n",

    "code": "from typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def reconstructQueue(self, people: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        # Sort the people by height (descending) and by k (ascending)\n        people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))\n        \n        queue = []\n        # Insert each person into the queue at the index specified by k\n        for person in people:\n            queue.insert(person[1], person)\n        \n        return queue",
    "explanation": "The solution begins by sorting the `people` list. The sorting is done using a custom key that sorts by height in descending order (to prioritize taller people) and by the number of people in front in ascending order (to ensure that when we insert, we respect the `k` condition). \n\nAfter sorting, we initialize an empty list called `queue`. We then iterate through the sorted `people` list and insert each person into the `queue` at the index specified by their `k` value. This insertion respects the condition that there are `k` people in front of them who are taller or of the same height.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the queue. Given the constraints (1 <= people.length <= 2000), this solution is efficient and works within the limits."
