    "title": "Reverse Words in a String",
    "description": "Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"the sky is blue\"\nOutput: \"blue is sky the\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"  hello world  \"\nOutput: \"world hello\"\nExplanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"a good   example\"\nOutput: \"example good a\"\nExplanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.\nThere is at least one word in s.\n\n \nFollow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?\n",

    "explanation": "The solution provided effectively reverses the words in the input string while ensuring that the output string adheres to the specified formatting requirements. \n\n1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traverse the string to strip spaces, split it into words, and then join the words back together.\n  \n2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage of the list of words created by the `split()` method. However, since we are not using any additional data structures beyond this, it is efficient in terms of space usage.\n\nOverall, this solution is optimal for the problem constraints and effectively handles all edge cases, such as leading/trailing spaces and multiple spaces between words."
