    "description": "You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.\nThe rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:\n\nA single period '.' represents the current directory.\nA double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.\nMultiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.\nAny sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.\n\nThe simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\n\nThe path must start with a single slash '/'.\nDirectories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.\nThe path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.\nThe path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.\n\nReturn the simplified canonical path.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: path = \"/home/\"\nOutput: \"/home\"\nExplanation:\nThe trailing slash should be removed.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: path = \"/home//foo/\"\nOutput: \"/home/foo\"\nExplanation:\nMultiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: path = \"/home/user/Documents/../Pictures\"\nOutput: \"/home/user/Pictures\"\nExplanation:\nA double period \"..\" refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: path = \"/../\"\nOutput: \"/\"\nExplanation:\nGoing one level up from the root directory is not possible.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: path = \"/.../a/../b/c/../d/./\"\nOutput: \"/.../b/d\"\nExplanation:\n\"...\" is a valid name for a directory in this problem.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= path.length <= 3000\npath consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.\npath is a valid absolute Unix path.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution uses a stack to keep track of the valid directory names as we process the input path. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input path, since we are iterating through the components of the path once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, where all components are valid directory names and are stored in the stack.\n\n1. **Splitting the Path**: The `split('/')` method divides the path into components based on the '/' delimiter.\n2. **Processing Components**: We check each component:\n   - Ignore empty strings and '.' as they do not affect the path.\n   - For '..', we pop from the stack if it is not empty, effectively moving up one directory.\n   - For valid directory names, we push them onto the stack.\n3. **Constructing the Result**: Finally, we join the components in the stack with '/' and prepend a '/' to ensure the path starts correctly.\n\nThis method ensures that we adhere to all the rules of a Unix-style file system while simplifying the path correctly."
