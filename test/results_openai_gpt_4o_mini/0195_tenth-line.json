If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?\r\n2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.\n",

    "explanation": "The function `print_tenth_line` takes a filename as input and attempts to open the file for reading. It uses a `for` loop combined with `enumerate` to iterate through each line of the file while keeping track of the line number. \n\n- When the line number reaches 9 (which corresponds to the 10th line due to 0-based indexing), it prints the line after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- If the loop completes without reaching the 10th line, it prints a message indicating that the file has fewer than 10 lines.\n- Additionally, the function includes error handling for the case where the specified file does not exist, printing an appropriate message.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the file. In the worst case, we may need to read all lines if the file has fewer than 10 lines.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is O(1) since we are not storing the lines in memory; we are processing them one at a time.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles edge cases appropriately."
