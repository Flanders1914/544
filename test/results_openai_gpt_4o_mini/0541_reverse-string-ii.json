If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"abcdefg\", k = 2\nOutput: \"bacdfeg\"\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"abcd\", k = 2\nOutput: \"bacd\"\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n1 <= k <= 104\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution iterates through the string `s` in chunks of size `2k`. For each chunk:\n- The first `k` characters are reversed using slicing and the `[::-1]` operation.\n- The next `k` characters are appended unchanged to the result list.\n- If there are fewer than `k` characters left at the end of the string, the entire remaining substring is reversed.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because we are processing each character a constant number of times. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of the result in a list before joining it into a string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including when the string length is less than `k` or when the string length is not a multiple of `2k`."
