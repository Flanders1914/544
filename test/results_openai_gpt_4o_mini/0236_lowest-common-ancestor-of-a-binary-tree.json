    "description": "Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2\nOutput: 1\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].\n-109 <= Node.val <= 109\nAll Node.val are unique.\np != q\np and q will exist in the tree.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. \n\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, we return `None`. If the current node matches either `p` or `q`, we return that node.\n2. **Recursive Calls**: We make recursive calls to the left and right children of the current node to search for `p` and `q`.\n3. **Determine LCA**: \n   - If both left and right recursive calls return non-null values, it indicates that `p` is found in one subtree and `q` in the other, making the current node the LCA.\n   - If only one of the calls returns a non-null value, we return that value up the recursion.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), H can be N, but in a balanced tree, it would be log(N).\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of binary trees and recursion."
