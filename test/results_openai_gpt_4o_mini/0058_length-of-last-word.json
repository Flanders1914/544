    "explanation": "The solution begins by trimming the input string `s` to remove any unnecessary spaces at the beginning and end. This is done using the `strip()` method. After trimming, we split the string into a list of words using the `split()` method, which by default splits by whitespace and handles multiple spaces correctly.\n\nOnce we have the list of words, we simply access the last word using `words[-1]` and return its length using the `len()` function. If for some reason the list of words is empty (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), we return 0.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we potentially traverse the entire string to trim and split it.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as we may need to store all the words in the list created by the `split()` method.\n\nOverall, this solution is efficient and straightforward, making good use of Python's string manipulation capabilities."
