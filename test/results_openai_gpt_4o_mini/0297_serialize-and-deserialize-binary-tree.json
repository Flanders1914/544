    "title": "Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree",
    "description": "Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\nClarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]\nOutput: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution consists of two main methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`.\n\n1. **Serialization**:\n   - We define a helper function `serialize_helper` that takes a node as input.\n   - If the node is `None`, we return a list containing the string \"null\".\n   - If the node is not `None`, we return a list that includes the node's value (converted to a string), followed by the serialized left and right subtrees.\n   - Finally, we join the list into a single string separated by commas.\n\n2. **Deserialization**:\n   - We define a helper function `deserialize_helper` that takes an iterator of node values.\n   - We read the next value from the iterator. If it is \"null\", we return `None`.\n   - If it is a valid integer, we create a new `TreeNode` and recursively build its left and right children using the same helper function.\n   - The main `deserialize` function splits the serialized string into a list and converts it into an iterator, which is then passed to the helper function.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- The time complexity for both serialization and deserialization is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) for the serialized string and O(h) for the recursion stack during deserialization, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), h can be O(n).\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the serialization and deserialization of a binary tree while adhering to the constraints provided."
