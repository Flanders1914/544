    "explanation": "The solution works by repeatedly dividing the input number by 7 and collecting the remainders, which represent the digits in base 7. \n\n1. **Negative Numbers**: If the input number is negative, we convert its absolute value and prepend a '-' sign to the result.\n2. **Zero Case**: If the input number is zero, we directly return \"0\" as its base 7 representation.\n3. **Loop for Conversion**: We use a while loop to divide the number by 7 until it becomes zero. In each iteration, we calculate the remainder (which gives us the next least significant digit in base 7) and append it to a list. After the loop, we reverse the list of digits to form the correct base 7 representation.\n4. **Joining Digits**: Finally, we join the list of string digits into a single string to return the result.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(log7(num)), where num is the input number. This is because we are dividing the number by 7 in each iteration, which reduces the size of the number logarithmically.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(log7(num)) as well, due to the storage of the digits in the list before joining them into a string.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently converts an integer to its base 7 representation while handling edge cases appropriately."
