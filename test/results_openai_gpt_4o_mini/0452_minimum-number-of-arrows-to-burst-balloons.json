    "title": "Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons",
    "description": "There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\nArrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\nGiven the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:\n- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].\n- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:\n- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].\n- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= points.length <= 105\npoints[i].length == 2\n-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution uses a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of arrows needed to burst all balloons. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Sorting**: The balloons are sorted based on their end positions. This allows us to efficiently determine when a new arrow is needed.\n\n2. **Initialization**: We start with one arrow and set the position of the last arrow to the end of the first balloon.\n\n3. **Iterating through Balloons**: For each subsequent balloon, we check if its start position is greater than the position of the last arrow. If it is, we increment our arrow count and update the last arrow position to the end of the current balloon.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The sorting step takes O(n log n), and the iteration through the list takes O(n), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n log n).\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of arrows required to burst all balloons, ensuring optimal performance even for larger inputs."
