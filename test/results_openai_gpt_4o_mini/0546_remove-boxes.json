    "explanation": "The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to maximize the points obtained from removing boxes. The 3D DP array `dp[l][r][k]` is constructed to store the maximum points obtainable for the subarray of boxes from index `l` to `r`, with `k` additional boxes of the same color as `boxes[r]` already removed.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array is initialized to handle all possible segments of the boxes.\n2. **Filling the DP Table**: The outer loops iterate over all possible segments defined by `l` and `r`. For each segment, we calculate the maximum points by considering:\n   - Removing all boxes of the same color as `boxes[r]` in one go.\n   - Combining results from previously computed segments if they match the color of `boxes[r]`.\n3. **Base Case**: When `l > r`, the score is 0 since there are no boxes left.\n\nThe final result is found in `dp[0][n - 1][0]`, which gives the maximum points for the entire array of boxes.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n^3) due to the three nested loops iterating over the boxes.\n**Space Complexity**: O(n^3) for the DP array.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum points while adhering to the constraints provided."
