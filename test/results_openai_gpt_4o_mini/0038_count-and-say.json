    "description": "The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:\n\ncountAndSay(1) = \"1\"\ncountAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).\n\nRun-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string \"3322251\" we replace \"33\" with \"23\", replace \"222\" with \"32\", replace \"5\" with \"15\" and replace \"1\" with \"11\". Thus the compressed string becomes \"23321511\".\nGiven a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: \"1211\"\nExplanation:\n\ncountAndSay(1) = \"1\"\ncountAndSay(2) = RLE of \"1\" = \"11\"\ncountAndSay(3) = RLE of \"11\" = \"21\"\ncountAndSay(4) = RLE of \"21\" = \"1211\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: \"1\"\nExplanation:\nThis is the base case.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 30\n\n \nFollow up: Could you solve it iteratively?",

    "explanation": "The solution iteratively constructs the count-and-say sequence. We start with the base case \"1\" and build each subsequent term by counting consecutive characters in the current term. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `result` with \"1\".\n2. **Loop through n-1 times**: For each iteration, we create a new list `next_result` to hold the next term's components.\n3. **Count consecutive characters**: We loop through the current `result`, counting how many times each character appears consecutively. When we encounter a different character, we append the count and the character to `next_result`.\n4. **Finalizing the term**: After the loop, we ensure to append the last counted character and its count.\n5. **Join and update**: We join `next_result` into a string and set it as the new `result`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(2^n) in the worst case due to the exponential growth of the sequence length, but since n is limited to 30, this is manageable. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the current term and the next term.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently generates the required term in the count-and-say sequence."
