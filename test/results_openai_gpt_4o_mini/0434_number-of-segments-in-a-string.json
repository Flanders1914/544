    "explanation": "The solution uses the `split()` method to divide the input string `s` into segments based on spaces. This method automatically handles multiple spaces and ignores any leading or trailing spaces, ensuring that we only count valid segments of non-space characters.\n\n1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we need to traverse the entire string to split it into segments.\n\n2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of segments created. In the worst case, if the string consists of only non-space characters, the space used will be proportional to the number of segments.\n\nOverall, this solution is efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for the problem constraints."
