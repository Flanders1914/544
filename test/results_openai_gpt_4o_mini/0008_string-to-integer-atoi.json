    "description": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.\nThe algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n\nWhitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (\" \").\nSignedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.\nConversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.\nRounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.\n\nReturn the integer as the final result.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation:\n\nThe underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \" -042\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"   -042\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -042\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -042\" (\"042\" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)\n               ^\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"1337c0d3\"\nOutput: 1337\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"1337c0d3\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"1337c0d3\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"1337c0d3\" (\"1337\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: s = \"0-1\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: \"0-1\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"0-1\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"0-1\" (\"0\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n          ^\n\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: s = \"words and 987\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nReading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length <= 200\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution begins by defining the boundaries for a 32-bit signed integer. We initialize an index to traverse the string, a sign variable to determine if the result should be positive or negative, and a total variable to accumulate the integer value.\n\n1. **Whitespace Handling**: We use a while loop to skip any leading whitespace characters until we reach a non-whitespace character or the end of the string.\n2. **Sign Detection**: We check if the current character is a '+' or '-' to set the sign. If neither is present, we assume a positive sign.\n3. **Digit Conversion**: We enter another while loop to read digits. For each digit, we convert it to an integer and check for potential overflow before updating the total. This is done by ensuring that the current total, when multiplied by 10 and added to the new digit, does not exceed the maximum integer value.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total multiplied by the sign.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string at most twice (once for whitespace and once for digits).\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified requirements and edge cases, ensuring correct conversion of the string to a 32-bit signed integer."
