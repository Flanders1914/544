    "description": "Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\nThe encoded string should be as compact as possible.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: [2,1,3]\nExample 2:\nInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 104\nThe input tree is guaranteed to be a binary search tree.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution consists of two main methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`.\n\n1. **Serialization**:\n   - We define a helper function `pre_order` that performs a pre-order traversal of the tree.\n   - If the current node is `None`, we append \"None,\" to the result string. Otherwise, we append the node's value followed by a comma, and recursively call `pre_order` for the left and right children.\n   - The final serialized string is a comma-separated list of node values and \"None\" for absent nodes.\n\n2. **Deserialization**:\n   - We split the serialized string by commas to get a list of values.\n   - We define a helper function `build_tree` that constructs the tree from the list of values.\n   - If the first value is \"None\", we pop it from the list and return `None`. Otherwise, we create a new `TreeNode` with the first value, pop it from the list, and recursively build the left and right subtrees.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- The time complexity for both serialization and deserialization is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during both processes.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) for the serialized string and O(h) for the recursion stack during deserialization, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), h can be O(n).\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently handles the serialization and deserialization of a binary search tree while maintaining the properties of the tree structure."
