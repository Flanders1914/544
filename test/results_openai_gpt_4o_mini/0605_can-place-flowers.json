    "explanation": "The solution iterates through the flowerbed array to check for suitable plots where flowers can be planted. The key steps in the solution are:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start with a count of 0 for the flowers we can plant and determine the length of the flowerbed.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each plot in the flowerbed:\n   - For each empty plot (0), we check if both adjacent plots are empty or out of bounds.\n   - If both conditions are satisfied, we plant a flower (set the plot to 1) and increment our count.\n   - If at any point our count reaches `n`, we return `True`.\n3. **Final Check**: After the loop, we check if the count of planted flowers is at least `n` and return the result.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(m), where m is the length of the flowerbed array. We traverse the array once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for variables and not utilizing any additional data structures.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines if the required number of flowers can be planted without violating the adjacency rule."
