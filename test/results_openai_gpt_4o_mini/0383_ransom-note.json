    "explanation": "The solution uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the `magazine`. We iterate through each character in `magazine` and populate the dictionary with the counts. Then, we iterate through each character in `ransomNote` and check if it exists in the dictionary with a count greater than zero. If it does, we decrement the count in the dictionary to indicate that we have used that character. If we encounter a character in `ransomNote` that is not available in sufficient quantity in `magazine`, we return `False`. If we successfully check all characters in `ransomNote`, we return `True`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of `magazine` and n is the length of `ransomNote`, since we are iterating through both strings once. The space complexity is O(1) in terms of the character count dictionary, as the maximum number of unique characters is limited to 26 (the lowercase English letters)."
