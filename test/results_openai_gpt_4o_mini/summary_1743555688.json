The left and right partitions are defined based on these indices.\n4. **Condition Checking**: We check if the maximum of the left partitions is less than or equal to the minimum of the right partitions. If this condition is satisfied, we have found the correct partitions.\n5. **Median Calculation**: Depending on whether the total number of elements is odd or even, we calculate the median accordingly.\n6. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is O(log(min(m, n))) due to the binary search on the smaller array.\n7. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for variables.\n\nThis efficient approach allows us to find the median without merging the arrays, thus adhering to the required time complexity constraints."

This is done by ensuring that the current total, when multiplied by 10 and added to the new digit, does not exceed the maximum integer value.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total multiplied by the sign.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string at most twice (once for whitespace and once for digits).\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified requirements and edge cases, ensuring correct conversion of the string to a 32-bit signed integer."

We iterate through each element in the array, treating it as a fixed element of the triplet. For each fixed element, we initialize two pointers: one starting just after the fixed element and the other at the end of the array.\n\nWe then calculate the sum of the triplet formed by the fixed element and the two pointers. If this sum is closer to the target than any previously found sum, we update our closest sum. Depending on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target, we adjust the pointers accordingly to explore other potential triplet combinations.\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure (one loop for fixing an element and another for the two-pointer search), which is efficient given the constraints (3 <= n <= 500). The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables, aside from the input array."

Each entry in the heap is a tuple containing the node's value, the index of the list it belongs to, and the node itself. This allows us to maintain the order based on the node values.\n\n2. **Merging Process**: We use a dummy node to simplify the merging process. We repeatedly extract the smallest node from the heap and append it to the merged list. If the extracted node has a next node, we push that next node into the heap.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all lists. Each insertion and extraction operation on the heap takes O(log k) time, and we perform these operations N times.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(k) due to the storage of the heap, which contains at most k nodes at any time.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as empty input lists and lists containing empty linked lists by checking if each list is non-empty before adding its head to the heap.\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of heaps to maintain sorted order while merging the lists."

We then adjust their `next` pointers to perform the swap.\n3. **Pointer Movement**: After swapping, we move the `prev` pointer to the `first` node (which is now the second node in the swapped pair) to prepare for the next iteration.\n4. **Termination**: The loop continues until there are no more pairs to swap.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space (the dummy node and a few pointers).\n\nThis approach efficiently swaps adjacent nodes without modifying the values in the nodes, adhering to the problem's constraints."

It uses a simple iterative approach to reverse the pointers.\n\n2. **Main Loop**: In the `reverseKGroup` method, we use a dummy node to simplify edge cases (like reversing the head of the list). We maintain a pointer `group_prev` that marks the end of the last reversed group.\n\n3. **Checking for k Nodes**: Before reversing, we check if there are at least k nodes available. If not, we return the modified list.\n\n4. **Reversing and Connecting**: After reversing the k nodes, we connect the end of the reversed segment back to the remaining list. We then move the `group_prev` pointer to the end of the newly reversed segment to prepare for the next iteration.\n\n5. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we traverse each node a constant number of times.\n\n6. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few pointers and not utilizing any additional data structures that grow with input size.\n\nThis solution efficiently reverses the linked list in groups of k while maintaining the required constraints."

It checks the row, column, and the corresponding 3x3 sub-box for the presence of the number.\n\n2. **solve Function**: This recursive function attempts to fill the board. It iterates through each cell, looking for an empty cell ('.'). For each empty cell, it tries placing numbers from '1' to '9'. If a number is valid, it places the number and recursively calls itself to continue solving. If it finds a solution, it returns `True`. If it cannot place any number, it backtracks by resetting the cell to '.' and trying the next number.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is O(9^(n*n)), where n is the size of the board (9 for a standard Sudoku). This is because, in the worst case, we may have to try all numbers for each empty cell.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n^2) for the recursion stack, where n is the size of the board (9). However, since we are modifying the board in place, the additional space used is minimal.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently solves the Sudoku puzzle by exploring all possible configurations through backtracking."

At each step, we compare the heights at the two pointers:\n   - If the height at the `left` pointer is less than or equal to that at the `right`, we check if it can trap water based on `left_max`. If it can, we calculate the trapped water and move the `left` pointer to the right.\n   - If the height at the `right` pointer is less, we perform a similar check and calculation for the `right` pointer and move it to the left.\n\n3. **Water calculation**: The water trapped at each position is determined by the difference between the maximum height seen so far from that side and the current height.\n\n4. **Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) because we traverse the height array once, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and max height variables.\n\nThis method is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints, ensuring that we can handle the maximum input sizes effectively."

If the sum exceeds 10, we carry over the excess to the next position.\n\n4. **Constructing the Final Result**: After populating the result array, we convert it to a string. We use `lstrip('0')` to remove any leading zeros, ensuring that the final output is correctly formatted.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively. This is because we are performing a multiplication operation for each digit of both numbers.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(m + n) for the result array used to store the intermediate results.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently handles the multiplication of large numbers represented as strings without converting them to integers directly."

The `totalNQueens` function initializes the necessary data structures and starts the recursive backtracking process. \n\n1. **Data Structures**:\n   - `self.count`: Keeps track of the number of valid configurations found.\n   - `self.columns`: A set to track which columns are occupied by queens.\n   - `self.major_diagonals`: A set to track occupied major diagonals (row - column).\n   - `self.minor_diagonals`: A set to track occupied minor diagonals (row + column).\n\n2. **Backtracking Logic**:\n   - The `backtrack` function attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row.\n   - If a column or diagonal is already occupied, it skips that position.\n   - If a queen is successfully placed, it recursively attempts to place queens in the next row.\n   - Upon reaching the base case (all queens placed), it increments the count.\n   - After exploring a position, it removes the queen (backtracks) and continues to explore other positions.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n!), as in the worst case, we may need to explore all permutations of queen placements.\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage used for the sets tracking columns and diagonals.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of distinct solutions for the N-Queens problem for values of n up to 9, as specified in the constraints."

For each element:\n   - We add the element to `current_sum`.\n   - If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, we update `max_sum`.\n   - If `current_sum` becomes negative, we reset it to zero because a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future subarray.\n3.

After sorting, the intervals are arranged in a way that any overlapping intervals will be adjacent to each other.\n\n2. **Merging**: We initialize an empty list called `merged` to store the merged intervals. We then loop through each interval in the sorted list:\n   - If `merged` is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last merged interval (i.e., the end of the last merged interval is less than the start of the current interval), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.\n   - If there is an overlap, we merge the current interval with the last one by updating the end of the last merged interval to be the maximum of the two ends.\n\n3. **Returning the Result**: After processing all intervals, we return the `merged` list, which contains all the non-overlapping intervals.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all intervals are non-overlapping and need to be stored in the `merged` list."

If this value is zero, we again return the head since the list remains unchanged.\n\nTo find the new head of the rotated list, we traverse the list to the `(length - k - 1)`-th node, which will become the new tail. The node immediately following this new tail will be the new head of the rotated list.\n\nFinally, we adjust the pointers: we set the next of the new tail to `None` to terminate the new list and connect the old tail to the old head to complete the rotation.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is O(n) due to the traversal of the list, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size."

This results in a total of (m+n-2) moves.\n\n2. **Using Binomial Coefficient**: The number of unique paths can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula \\( C(m+n-2, m-1) \\). This represents the number of ways to choose (m-1) down moves from (m+n-2) total moves.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of calculating factorials directly, we compute the numerator and denominator iteratively to avoid overflow and improve efficiency. The loop runs for (m-1) iterations, multiplying the numerator by the decreasing total moves and the denominator by the increasing index.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(min(m, n)), as we only iterate through the smaller of the two dimensions to compute the paths.\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for the variables.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the number of unique paths without the need for large factorial computations, making it suitable for the given constraints."

We continue the loop until both indices are out of bounds and there is no carry left.\n3. **Calculate the sum**: For each position, we add the corresponding bits from `a` and `b` (if they exist) along with the carry. The sum is calculated, and we determine the new bit to append to the result and the new carry.\n4. **Final result**: After the loop, if there is still a carry, we append it to the result. Finally, we reverse the result list and join it to form the final binary string.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings `a` and `b`.

We also keep track of whether the first row and first column themselves need to be zeroed out.\n\n2. **Setting Zeroes Phase**: In the second pass, we start from the second row and second column (to avoid overwriting our markers) and set the elements to zero if their corresponding row or column marker (in the first row or first column) is zero.\n\nFinally, we check if the first row or first column needs to be zeroed based on our earlier flags and set them accordingly.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns, since we traverse the matrix a couple of times.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using the input matrix itself for marking and not using any additional data structures.\n\nThis approach efficiently modifies the matrix in place while adhering to the constraints provided."

For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].\nGiven the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.\nYou must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0\nOutput: true\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3\nOutput: false\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 5000\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\nnums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.\n-104 <= target <= 104\n\n \nFollow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?\n",

        "explanation": "The solution employs a modified binary search algorithm to efficiently search for the target in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.\n\n2. **Binary Search Loop**: We enter a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index `mid`.\n\n3. **Target Check**: If the value at `mid` equals the target, we return `True`.\n\n4. **Duplicate Handling**: If the values at `left`, `mid`, and `right` are equal, we cannot determine which side is sorted, so we increment `left` and decrement `right` to skip duplicates.\n\n5. **Sorted Half Identification**: We check if the left half is sorted. If it is, we determine if the target lies within this range. If it does, we adjust the `right` pointer; otherwise, we adjust the `left` pointer. The same logic applies to the right half.\n\n6. **Termination**: If the loop exits without finding the target, we return `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n) due to the potential need to skip duplicates, which can lead to examining each element in the array.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.\n\nOverall, this solution effectively handles the problem constraints and efficiently searches for the target in the rotated sorted array."

We append a zero to the `heights` list to ensure that we can process all remaining bars in the stack at the end.\n\n2. **Iterating through heights**: We loop through each index `i` in the `heights` list. For each height, we check if it is less than the height of the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack.\n\n3. **Calculating area**: If the current height is less, we pop the index from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed with the height of the popped index. The width is determined by the difference between the current index and the index of the new top of the stack (after popping). If the stack is empty after popping, it means the popped height was the smallest so far, and the width extends from the start to the current index.\n\n4. **Updating max_area**: We update `max_area` with the maximum area found during the calculations.\n\n5. **Pushing current index**: After processing the heights that are taller than the current height, we push the current index onto the stack.\n\n6. **Final return**: After the loop, we return `max_area`, which contains the area of the largest rectangle found.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(n) - The stack can hold up to n indices in the worst case.\n\nThis efficient approach allows us to handle the constraints of the problem effectively."

        "explanation": "The solution involves two main parts: calculating the heights of the histogram and finding the maximal rectangle area for each histogram.\n\n1. **Height Calculation**: We iterate through each row of the matrix. For each column, if the current cell is '1', we increment the height of that column; if it's '0', we reset the height to 0. This gives us a histogram representation of the matrix.\n\n2. **Maximal Rectangle in Histogram**: For each updated heights array, we call the helper function `_maxHistogramArea`. This function uses a stack to efficiently calculate the maximum rectangular area that can be formed in the histogram. We iterate through the heights, and for each height, we maintain a stack of indices. When we encounter a height that is less than the height at the index on the top of the stack, we pop from the stack and calculate the area using the popped height as the smallest height.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. We process each cell once and calculate the area for each row's histogram.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(m) for the heights array and O(m) for the stack used in the histogram area calculation.\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints of the problem."

The larger of the two is placed at index `k` in `nums1`, and we decrement the respective pointer (`i` or `j`) and `k`. This continues until we have processed all elements from either `nums1` or `nums2`.\n\n3. **Handling Remaining Elements**: If there are any remaining elements in `nums2` (i.e., `j` is still non-negative), we copy them directly into `nums1`. This is necessary because if `nums1` has already been filled with larger elements, the remaining elements in `nums2` will be smaller and should be placed at the beginning of `nums1`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(m + n) because we traverse both arrays once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are modifying `nums1` in place and not using any additional data structures.\n\nThis solution efficiently merges the two sorted arrays while adhering to the constraints provided."

This is crucial because it allows us to easily identify when we encounter a duplicate number.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function is defined to explore all subsets. It takes two parameters: `start`, which indicates the current index in `nums`, and `path`, which holds the current subset being constructed.\n\n3. **Base Case**: At the beginning of each call to `backtrack`, the current subset (`path`) is added to the `result`. This ensures that all subsets, including the empty subset, are captured.\n\n4. **Looping through Elements**: The loop iterates through the elements starting from the `start` index. If a duplicate is found (i.e., `nums[i] == nums[i - 1]`), it is skipped to prevent adding the same subset multiple times.\n\n5. **Recursive Calls**: For each element, we include it in the current subset and make a recursive call to explore further elements. After returning from the recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last added element from `path`.\n\n6. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, as we potentially generate all subsets. The sorting step takes O(n log n), but this is dominated by the subset generation.\n\n7. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for the recursion stack and the storage of the result.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently generates all unique subsets of the input list while handling duplicates appropriately."

We perform the reversal by adjusting the `next` pointers of the nodes in the specified range.\n\nFinally, we reconnect the reversed sublist back to the original list by linking the node after `right` to the end of the reversed portion and returning the new head of the list, which is `dummy.next`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the list a constant number of times, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a few pointers for the reversal process."

The `is_valid` function checks if a segment is a valid IP address segment by ensuring it is between 0 and 255 and does not have leading zeros (except for the segment \"0\"). \n\nThe `backtrack` function is the core of the solution. It takes the current starting index and the path (list of segments) as arguments. If we have formed four segments and used all characters in the string, we join the segments with dots and add the result to the list. \n\nWe iterate over possible segment lengths (1 to 3) and check if the segment formed is valid. If valid, we add it to the path and recursively call `backtrack` to continue forming the next segment. After exploring that path, we remove the last segment (backtrack) to try other possibilities.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(1) in terms of the number of valid IP addresses generated since the maximum number of valid IP addresses is limited by the constraints of the problem. The space complexity is O(1) for the result storage, but the recursion stack can go up to O(4) due to the maximum depth of segments.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently explores all valid combinations while adhering to the constraints of valid IP addresses."

If not, we return `False`.

We then fill the first row and first column of the `dp` table based on whether the characters of `s2` and `s1` match with `s3`.\n\n3. **Filling the DP Table**: For each character in `s1` and `s2`, we check if we can form the corresponding character in `s3` by either taking from `s1` or `s2`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is `True` if either the character from `s1` matches the current character in `s3` and the previous state `dp[i-1][j]` is `True`, or the character from `s2` matches and the previous state `dp[i][j-1]` is `True`.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The value at `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` gives the final answer.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the length of `s1` and m is the length of `s2`, since we fill a table of size (n"

This is necessary to determine the bounds for the recursive function that constructs the BST.\n\n2. **convert_list_to_bst**: This function is a recursive function that constructs the BST. It takes two parameters, `left` and `right`, which represent the current bounds of the linked list segment being processed. \n   - If `left` is greater than `right`, it means there are no nodes to process, and it returns `None`.\n   - It calculates the middle index and recursively constructs the left subtree before creating the root node with the current head value.\n   - After creating the root node, it advances the head pointer to the next node in the linked list and then constructs the right subtree.\n\nThe overall time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as each node is processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursion stack, which is required for the height of the tree in the case of a balanced BST."

        "explanation": "The provided solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all root-to-leaf paths in the binary tree. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:\n\n1. **DFS Function**: A helper function `dfs` is defined to traverse the tree. It takes the current node, the path taken so far, and the sum of the values in that path.\n\n2. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, the function returns immediately, as there is nothing to process.\n\n3. **Path and Sum Update**: The current node's value is added to the `current_path` list and the `current_sum` is updated.\n\n4. **Leaf Node Check**: If the current node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), we check if the `current_sum` equals the `targetSum`. If it does, we append a copy of the `current_path` to the `result` list.\n\n5. **Recursive Calls**: If the current node is not a leaf, the function recursively calls itself for the left and right children.\n\n6. **Backtracking**: After exploring both children, the last node is removed from the `current_path` to backtrack and explore other paths.\n\n7. **Result Compilation**: Finally, the `result` list containing all valid paths is returned.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we may visit every node once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space used by the recursion stack and the space used to store the paths in the result list.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently finds all root-to-leaf paths that sum to the specified target value."

The `tail` pointer is used to keep track of the last connected node in the next level.\n4. **Inner Loop**: For each node in the current level, we check if it has a left or right child. If it does, we connect it to the `tail` and move the `tail` pointer to the newly connected child.\n5. **Move to Next Level**: After processing all nodes at the current level, we move the `current` pointer to the first node of the next level using the `dummy` node.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) for the extra space used, as we only use a few pointers and the existing `next` pointers for traversal.\n\nThis solution efficiently populates the next right pointers in the binary tree while adhering to the constraints provided."

It uses `max(..., 0)` to ensure that only positive contributions are considered, as negative values would decrease the overall path sum.\n3. **Current Path Calculation**: The current path sum is calculated by adding the node's value to the maximum gains from both children. This value is then compared with the global maximum path sum (`self.max_sum`), which is updated if the current path sum is greater.\n4. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum gain that can be passed to the parent node, which is the node's value plus the maximum of the left or right gains.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be O(N), but in a balanced tree, it would be O(log N).\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently computes the maximum path sum in a binary tree by leveraging recursion and maintaining a global maximum."

        "explanation": "The solution begins by normalizing the input string `s`. This is done using a generator expression that iterates over each character in the string, converts it to lowercase, and includes it in the new string only if it is alphanumeric (using the `isalnum()` method). The `join` method is then used to concatenate these characters into a single string, `normalized_str`.\n\nNext, we check if `normalized_str` is equal to its reverse (`normalized_str[::-1]`). If they are equal, it means the string is a palindrome, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we traverse the string twice: once for normalization and once for the palindrome check. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of the normalized string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints provided, ensuring that even the maximum input size is processed in a reasonable time frame."

We begin with `beginWord` and its initial path. In each iteration, we generate all possible transformations of the current words by changing one letter at a time. If a transformed word exists in the `wordSet`, we add it to the `newLayer` with all paths leading to it.\n\n2. **Path Construction**: When we reach `endWord`, we return the paths stored in `layer[endWord]`. This ensures that we only return the shortest paths since BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(N * M^2) where N is the number of words in the wordList and M is the length of each word. This is due to the BFS exploring each word and generating M possible transformations for each.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N * M) for storing the paths and the wordSet.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds all shortest transformation sequences while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement."

        "explanation": "The provided solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree. The `dfs` function takes two parameters: the current node and the number formed by the path from the root to that node.\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, we return 0 since there is no number to add.\n2. **Current Number Calculation**: For each node, we update the `current_number` by multiplying it by 10 (to shift the digits left) and adding the node's value.\n3. **Leaf Node Check**: If the current node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), we return the `current_number` as it represents a complete number formed from the root to this leaf.\n4. **Recursive Calls**: We recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children, accumulating their results.\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns the sum of the numbers from both subtrees.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be N, but in a balanced tree, it would be log(N).\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently computes the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers in the binary tree."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to identify and mark 'O' cells that are connected to the borders of the board. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We first check if the board is empty. If it is, we return immediately. We then determine the number of rows and columns in the board.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined to explore the board. It marks 'O' cells as 'E' (escaped) to indicate that they are connected to the border. The function checks for out-of-bounds conditions and only proceeds if the current cell is an 'O'.\n\n3. **Marking Border 'O's**: We iterate through the border cells of the board. If we find an 'O', we call the `dfs` function to mark all connected 'O's.\n\n4. **Capturing and Restoring**: After marking, we traverse the board again. Any 'O' that remains unmarked is surrounded and is changed to 'X'. Any 'E' is restored back to 'O'.\n\n5. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is because we potentially visit every cell in the board once.\n\n6. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) if we disregard the input board, as we are modifying it in place. The recursion stack for DFS could go as deep as O(m * n) in the worst case, but this is not counted as additional space since it is part of the call stack.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently captures the surrounded regions while adhering to the problem's constraints."

If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no graph to clone.\n\n2. **Cloning Logic**: We define a helper function `dfs` that takes an original node as input. Inside this function:\n   - We check if the node has already been cloned by looking it up in the `cloned_nodes` dictionary. If it exists, we return the cloned node to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n   - If the node is not in the dictionary, we create a new `Node` instance with the same value as the original node and store it in the dictionary.\n   - We then iterate through each neighbor of the original node, recursively calling `dfs` to clone each neighbor and append it to the cloned node's neighbors list.\n\n3. **Return Value**: Finally, we call the `dfs` function starting from the input node and return the cloned graph's root node.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph. Each node and its edges are processed once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(N) for the dictionary that stores the mapping of original nodes to cloned nodes, and O(N) for the recursion stack in the worst case (if the graph is a linear chain).\n\nThis solution efficiently clones the graph while maintaining the structure and relationships of the original graph."

This means that if a bit has appeared once and appears again, it should now be counted in `twos`.\n   - We update `ones` using the XOR operation with the current number. This will toggle the bits in `ones` based on the current number.\n\n3. **Remove bits that appear three times**: We create a mask `threes` that captures bits that have appeared in both `ones` and `twos`. We then clear these bits from both `ones` and `twos` using the bitwise AND with the negation of `threes`.\n\n4. **Return the result**: After processing all numbers, `ones` will contain the bits of the number that appears only once, which we return.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array, since we only make a single pass through the array.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for the variables `ones`, `twos`, and `threes`.\n\nThis method is efficient and meets the problem's constraints perfectly."

For each node, we create a new node with the same value and insert it right after the original node. This allows us to maintain the order of nodes while also making it easy to set up the `next` pointers later.\n\n2. **Setting Random Pointers**: In the second pass, we set the `random` pointers for the newly created nodes. Since each new node is directly after its corresponding original node, we can access the new node corresponding to an original node's `random` pointer by using `current.random.next`.\n\n3. **Separating the Lists**: In the final step, we restore the original list by adjusting the `next` pointers of the original nodes and simultaneously build the new list by linking the copied nodes together.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we traverse the list a constant number of times.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) if we disregard the space used by the new nodes, as we are only using a few pointers for traversal. The new nodes themselves take O(n) space, which is necessary for the deep copy.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently creates a deep copy of the linked list with random pointers while maintaining the structure and relationships of the original list."

We also initialize a stack to keep track of the nodes we need to visit.\n\n2. **Starting Point**: If the root is not null, we push it onto the stack.\n\n3. **Traversal Loop**: We enter a while loop that continues until the stack is empty. Inside the loop:\n   - We pop the top node from the stack.\n   - We append the value of this node to the `result` list.\n   - We then check if the node has a right child. If it does, we push it onto the stack. We do the same for the left child.

In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the stack can grow to the height of the tree, which is O(n).

        "explanation": "The provided solution implements the insertion sort algorithm for a singly linked list. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Dummy Node**: A dummy node is created to simplify the insertion process. It acts as a placeholder for the head of the sorted list, allowing us to easily insert nodes without special cases for the head.\n\n2. **Outer Loop**: We iterate through each node in the original list using the `current` pointer. For each node, we need to find its correct position in the sorted list.\n\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop (`while prev.next and prev.next.val < current.val`) traverses the sorted list to find the appropriate position for the `current` node. The `prev` pointer helps in locating where to insert the `current` node.\n\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position is found, we adjust the pointers:\n   - `next_temp` stores the next node to be processed from the original list.\n   - We link `current` to the next node in the sorted list (`prev.next`).\n   - We then link `prev` to `current`, effectively inserting it into the sorted list.\n\n5. **Return**: After processing all nodes, we return `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the newly sorted list.\n\n**Complexity Analysis**:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the list. This occurs when the list is sorted in reverse order.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space (the dummy node).\n\nThis solution efficiently sorts the linked list in place using the insertion sort algorithm."

Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Base Case**: The function first checks if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, it returns the head as it is already sorted.\n\n2. **Splitting the List**: The `split` function uses the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle. The list is then split into two halves.\n\n3. **Recursive Sorting**: The `sortList` function is called recursively on both halves of the list until the base case is reached.\n\n4. **Merging**: The `merge` function takes two sorted linked lists and merges them into a single sorted linked list. It uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because the list is repeatedly split in half (log n splits), and merging takes O(n) time.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for the merging process since we are not using any additional data structures for the nodes, only a few pointers.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently sorts the linked list while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement."

As we iterate through the array starting from the second element, we check if the current number is negative. If it is, we swap `max_so_far` and `min_so_far` because multiplying by a negative number will turn the maximum product into a minimum product and vice versa.\n\nNext, we update `max_so_far` to be the maximum of the current number itself or the product of `max_so_far` and the current number. Similarly, we update `min_so_far` to be the minimum of the current number or the product of `min_so_far` and the current number. This ensures that we are always keeping track of the potential maximum and minimum products at each step.\n\nFinally, we update the `result` with the maximum value found so far. After iterating through the entire array, we return the `result`, which contains the maximum product of any subarray.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the array once, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size."

Therefore, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n     - If `nums[mid]` is less than or equal to `nums[right]`, it indicates that the minimum element is in the left half (including `mid`).

If this value is equal to the top of `min_stack`, we also pop from `min_stack`, ensuring that the minimum value is always correctly updated.\n\n4. **Top Operation**: This simply returns the last element of `stack`, which is the top of the stack.\n\n5. **GetMin Operation**: This returns the last element of `min_stack`, which is the minimum value in the stack.\n\n**Time Complexity**: All operations (push, pop, top, getMin) run in O(1) time.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the stack, as we may need to store all elements in both stacks.\n\nThis implementation efficiently meets the problem's requirements and constraints."

        "title": "Intersection of Two Linked Lists",
        "description": "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\nFor example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:\n\nThe test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\nNote that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\nCustom Judge:\nThe inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):\n\nintersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\nlistA - The first linked list.\nlistB - The second linked list.\nskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\nskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at '2'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\nOutput: No intersection\nExplanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\nThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n0 <= skipA <= m\n0 <= skipB <= n\nintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\nintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n\n \nFollow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?",

This is because we make a single pass through the array to determine the majority element. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the candidate and count variables, regardless of the input size.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1. We initialize a `candidate` variable to keep track of the potential majority element and a `count` variable to track how many times we've seen this candidate.\n2. As we iterate through the array, if the `count` is zero, we set the current number as the new candidate.\n3. We then increment the count if the current number matches the candidate, or decrement it if it does not.\n4. By the end of the loop, the candidate will be the majority element, as it is guaranteed to appear more than n/2 times.\n\nThis method is efficient and meets the problem's requirements for linear time and constant space."

For each index `i`, we extract the substring `s[i:i + 10]`.\n\n3. **Checking for repetitions**: \n   - If the substring is already in the `seen` set, it means we have encountered it before, so we add it to the `repeated` set.\n   - If it is not in the `seen` set, we add it to the `seen` set for future reference.\n\n4. **Returning results**: Finally, we convert the `repeated` set to a list and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string.

This ensures we only perform necessary rotations.\n  \n2. **Reversing the entire array**: By reversing the entire array, the last `k` elements are moved to the front but in reverse order.\n\n3. **Reversing the first `k` elements**: This step corrects the order of the last `k` elements, placing them in their final positions.\n\n4. **Reversing the remaining elements**: Finally, we reverse the first `n-k` elements to restore their original order.\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n) because we traverse the array a constant number of times (three reversals).

If it's empty, we return 0. If it has one element, we return that element since that's the only money available to rob.\n\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each house's money in `nums`. For each house, we calculate the maximum amount that can be robbed by either:\n   - Not robbing the current house (taking the value of `prev1`).\n   - Robbing the current house (adding the current house's money to `prev2`).\n\n3. **Updating Values**: After calculating the current maximum, we update `prev2` to be `prev1` (the previous maximum) and `prev1` to be the current maximum.\n\n4. **Final Result**: After processing all houses, `prev1` contains the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of houses, since we traverse the list once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space for the two variables.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the maximum constraints of the problem effectively."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a dummy node to simplify the removal of nodes from the linked list. The dummy node is initialized to point to the head of the list. We then use a `current` pointer to traverse the list. For each node, we check if the next node's value equals `val`. If it does, we skip that node by changing the `next` pointer of the `current` node to point to the node after the next. If it does not match, we simply move the `current` pointer to the next node.\n\nThis approach ensures that we can handle cases where the head of the list needs to be removed without special cases. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we traverse the list once. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space (the dummy node)."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to detect cycles in the directed graph formed by the courses and their prerequisites. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. **Graph Construction**: We first create an adjacency list representation of the graph where each course points to the courses that depend on it.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function checks for cycles:\n   - If we encounter a course that is currently being visited (state 1), we return `False` indicating a cycle.\n   - If we encounter a course that has already been fully processed (state 2), we return `True`.\n   - We mark the course as visiting (state 1) and recursively visit all its neighbors.\n   - After processing all neighbors, we mark the course as visited (state 2).\n\n3. **Main Loop**: We iterate through all courses, and for each unvisited course, we call the `dfs` function. If any call returns `False`, we conclude that it's impossible to finish all courses.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (vertices) and E is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges). Each course and each prerequisite is processed once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for the graph representation and O(V) for the visited list, leading to a total space complexity of O(V + E).\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently determines if all courses can be completed based on the given prerequisites."

The `WordDictionary` class has two main methods: `addWord` and `search`.\n\n1. **addWord(word)**: This method inserts a word into the Trie. It iterates through each character of the word, creating new Trie nodes as necessary. When the last character is added, it marks the node as the end of a word.\n\n2. **search(word)**: This method checks if a word exists in the Trie, allowing for the use of dots ('.') as wildcards. It calls a helper function `_search_in_node`, which recursively traverses the Trie. If it encounters a dot, it checks all possible child nodes for a match.\n\nThe time complexity for both `addWord` and `search` is O(L), where L is the length of the word being added or searched. The space complexity is O(N * L), where N is the number of words added to the Trie, as each word can contribute to the Trie structure.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles the constraints provided, allowing for up to 10,000 calls to `addWord` and `search` with words of length up to 25."

Next, we reverse the string `s` to create `rev_s` and concatenate `s`, a separator `#`, and `rev_s` into a new string called `combined`. This concatenation helps us to avoid overlaps when we compute the longest palindromic prefix.\n\nWe then construct the KMP prefix table (`lps`) for the `combined` string. The `lps` array helps us find the longest prefix which is also a suffix efficiently. The last value of the `lps` array gives us the length of the longest palindromic prefix in the original string `s`.\n\nUsing this length, we determine the characters that need to be added in front of `s` by taking the corresponding characters from `rev_s`. Finally, we concatenate these characters with `s` to form the shortest palindrome and return it.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) due to the linear scan for building the `lps` array, and the space complexity is also O(n) for storing the `lps` array. This makes the solution efficient and suitable for the input constraints provided."

Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.\nNote: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]\nOutput: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]\nExplanation:\nFigure A shows the buildings of the input.\nFigure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]\nOutput: [[0,3],[5,0]]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= buildings.length <= 104\n0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1\n1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1\nbuildings is sorted by lefti in non-decreasing order.\n\n",

        "explanation": "The solution uses a sweep line algorithm to efficiently compute the skyline formed by a set of buildings. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Event Creation**: Each building generates two events: one for its start and one for its end. These events are stored in a list.\n\n2. **Sorting Events**: The events are sorted by their x-coordinates. If two events have the same x-coordinate, the start event is processed before the end event. This ensures that we handle overlapping buildings correctly.\n\n3. **Max-Heap for Heights**: A max-heap is used to keep track of the heights of the buildings that are currently active. The heap allows us to efficiently retrieve the maximum height at any point.\n\n4. **Processing Events**: As we process each event:\n   - For a start event, we add the building's height to the heap.\n   - For an end event, we remove the height from the heap. This is done by filtering the heap and re-heapifying, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n5. **Key Points Generation**: Whenever the maximum height changes, we record a new key point in the result.\n\nThe overall time complexity is O(N log N) due to the sorting of events and the heap operations, while the space complexity is O(N) for storing the events and the heap. This makes the solution efficient and suitable for the input constraints."

        "explanation": "The solution begins by defining a helper function `getHeight` that calculates the height of the tree by traversing down the leftmost path. This height is crucial for determining the number of nodes.\n\nNext, we define another helper function `exists` that checks if a node exists at a given index in the last level of the tree. This function uses binary search to efficiently determine the presence of nodes.\n\nFinally, we perform a binary search on the range of possible indices for the last level nodes (from 1 to `2^height - 1`). For each index, we use the `exists` function to check if a node exists at that index. The loop continues until we find the total number of nodes, which is the sum of the nodes in a complete tree of height `height - 1` and the count of nodes in the last level.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is `O(log^2 n)` due to the height calculation and the binary search for each index, while the space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of space for variables."

        "explanation": "In this solution, we have implemented a stack using two queues. The `MyStack` class contains two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`, which are used to manage the elements in a way that simulates stack behavior.\n\n1. **Push Operation**: When we push an element, we add it to `queue2`. We then transfer all elements from `queue1` to `queue2`, ensuring that the new element is at the front of `queue1` after the swap. This operation is O(n) because we may need to move all elements from one queue to another.\n\n2. **Pop Operation**: The pop operation simply removes and returns the front element of `queue1`, which is the last element added to the stack. This operation is O(1).\n\n3. **Top Operation**: The top operation retrieves the front element of `queue1` without removing it, which is also O(1).\n\n4. **Empty Operation**: The empty operation checks if `queue1` is empty, which is O(1).\n\nOverall, the time complexity for `push` is O(n), while `pop`, `top`, and `empty` operations are O(1). The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of elements in the queues.\n\nThis implementation effectively simulates stack behavior using queues while adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement."

This ensures that we are effectively tracking the most likely candidates for the majority elements.\n\n2. **Verifying Candidates**: After identifying potential candidates, we perform a second pass through the array to count the actual occurrences of these candidates. We then check if their counts exceed n/3. If they do, we add them to the result list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we make two passes through the array, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently finds all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in the input array."

The in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order, which is a key property of BSTs. \n\n1. **In-order Traversal**: The function `in_order_traversal` is defined to recursively visit the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child. This ensures that we visit nodes in sorted order.\n\n2. **Counting Nodes**: A counter (`self.count`) is used to keep track of how many nodes have been visited. When this counter equals `k`, we store the current node's value in `self.kth_value`.\n\n3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when a null node is reached, ensuring that we do not attempt to access properties of non-existent nodes.\n\n4. **Return Value**: After the traversal, the value of `self.kth_value` is returned, which holds the kth smallest value.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(H + k), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), this can be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it is O(log n).\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H) due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this can also be O(n) for a skewed tree.\n\nThis approach is efficient and straightforward for finding the kth smallest element in a BST."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently determine if a linked list is a palindrome. \n\n1. **Finding the Middle**: The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle. This takes O(n) time.\n\n2. **Reversing the Second Half**: We reverse the second half of the list starting from the slow pointer. This is done in O(n) time as well, and we only use a few pointers, maintaining O(1) space complexity.\n\n3. **Comparing Halves**: We then compare the values of the nodes in the first half with the nodes in the reversed second half. This comparison also takes O(n) time.\n\nOverall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size. \n\nThis approach is efficient and meets the problem's requirements, making it suitable for large linked lists up to the constraint limits."

We start at the root of the tree and enter a loop that continues until we find the LCA.\n2. Inside the loop, we check the values of `p` and `q` against the current node's value:\n   - If both `p` and `q` are less than the current node's value, we move to the left child.\n   - If both are greater, we move to the right child.\n   - If one is on the left and the other is on the right, or if one of them is equal to the current node, we have found the LCA, and we return the current node.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

        "explanation": "The solution uses a recursive function `compute` to evaluate all possible results of the given expression. The function checks if the expression is a number and returns it directly if so. If the expression contains operators, it iterates through each character in the string. When it finds an operator, it splits the expression into left and right parts and recursively computes the results for both parts.\n\nFor each combination of results from the left and right parts, it applies the operator and stores the result. The results for each unique expression are cached in the `memo` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations, which optimizes the performance.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is exponential in the worst case due to the recursive nature of the problem, as we explore all possible ways to parenthesize the expression. However, memoization significantly reduces the number of computations by caching results for sub-expressions.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is O(n) for the memoization dictionary, where n is the length of the expression. Additionally, the recursion stack may also take up space proportional to the depth of the recursion, which can be up to O(n) in the worst case.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently computes all possible results for the given expression while adhering to the constraints provided."

We call `Counter(t)` to create a frequency count for string `t`.\n3. We then compare the two `Counter` objects. If they are equal, it means both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies, and thus `t` is an anagram of `s`.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement. \n\nFor the follow-up question regarding Unicode characters, the same approach can be used since `Counter` can handle any hashable object, including Unicode characters. The only consideration would be the potential increase in space complexity depending on the variety of characters in the input strings.\n\nOverall, the time complexity remains O(n) and the space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the input strings."

It checks if the node is not `None`, appends the node's value to the path, and checks if the node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`).\n   - If it is a leaf, the current path is added to the `paths` list.\n   - If it is not a leaf, the function appends '->' to the path and recursively calls itself for the left and right children.\n\n2. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when a leaf node is reached, ensuring that all paths from the root to each leaf are collected.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be equal to N.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently collects all root-to-leaf paths in the binary tree and returns them as a list of strings."

        "explanation": "The solution checks if a given integer `n` is an ugly number by following these steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the function returns `False` since ugly numbers are defined as positive integers.\n\n2. **Dividing by Prime Factors**: The function then iterates over the list of prime factors `[2, 3, 5]`. For each prime factor, it uses a while loop to divide `n` by that factor as long as `n` is divisible by it. This effectively removes all occurrences of that prime factor from `n`.\n\n3. **Final Check**: After attempting to divide by all three prime factors, if `n` has been reduced to 1, it means that the original number was composed solely of the prime factors 2, 3, and 5, and thus it is an ugly number. If `n` is not 1, it means there were other prime factors involved, and the function returns `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) because the number of divisions performed is proportional to the logarithm of `n` with respect to the prime factors.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.\n\nOverall, this solution is efficient and straightforward, effectively determining if a number is ugly based on its prime factorization."

If it does, we retrieve that element and store it in `next_element`.\n\n2. **Peek Method**: The `peek()` method simply returns the value of `next_element`, which represents the next item in the iteration without moving the iterator forward.\n\n3. **Next Method**: The `next()` method retrieves the current `next_element`, checks if there is another element in the iterator, and if so, updates `next_element` with the next value from the iterator. If there are no more elements, it sets `next_element` to `None`.\n\n4. **HasNext Method**: The `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements to iterate over, based on the state of `has_next`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: \n- `next()`, `peek()`, and `hasNext()` all run in O(1) time since they involve simple variable accesses and checks.\n\n**Space Complexity**: \n- O(1) additional space is used, as we only store a few variables regardless of the size of the input.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and meets the problem's requirements while being easy to understand and maintain."

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThe next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.\nGiven the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.\nNote that you do not need to return anything.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nm == board.length\nn == board[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 25\nboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n \nFollow up:\n\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the board in-place without using any additional data structures."

        "explanation": "The solution consists of two main methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`.\n\n1. **Serialization**:\n   - We define a helper function `serialize_helper` that takes a node as input.\n   - If the node is `None`, we return a list containing the string \"null\".\n   - If the node is not `None`, we return a list that includes the node's value (converted to a string), followed by the serialized left and right subtrees.\n   - Finally, we join the list into a single string separated by commas.\n\n2. **Deserialization**:\n   - We define a helper function `deserialize_helper` that takes an iterator of node values.\n   - We read the next value from the iterator. If it is \"null\", we return `None`.\n   - If it is a valid integer, we create a new `TreeNode` and recursively build its left and right children using the same helper function.\n   - The main `deserialize` function splits the serialized string into a list and converts it into an iterator, which is then passed to the helper function.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- The time complexity for both serialization and deserialization is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) for the serialized string and O(h) for the recursion stack during deserialization, where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a skewed tree), h can be O(n).\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the serialization and deserialization of a binary tree while adhering to the constraints provided."

If they do not match, we update the counts in `secret_count` and `guess_count` for the respective digits.\n\n2. **Counting Cows**: After identifying bulls, we loop through the digit counts (0-9) and calculate the number of cows by taking the minimum of the counts from `secret_count` and `guess_count`.

If at any point the count goes negative, it indicates an invalid configuration.\n\n2. **BFS Implementation**: We initialize a queue with the original string and a set to track visited strings. We process each string in the queue:\n   - If the string is valid, we add it to the result list and set a flag indicating that we found valid strings.\n   - If we have found valid strings, we stop further exploration at that level to ensure we only return strings with the minimum number of removals.\n   - For each character in the current string, if it is a parenthesis, we generate a new string by removing that character and add it to the queue if it hasn't been visited.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario involves generating all possible strings by removing parentheses, which can be exponential in nature. However, since the maximum length of the string is 25 and there are at most 20 parentheses, the BFS will be manageable within these constraints.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is primarily due to the queue and the visited set, which can also grow exponentially in the worst case, but is limited by the number of unique strings generated.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently finds all unique valid strings with the minimum number of invalid parentheses removed."

        "explanation": "The `NumArray` class is designed to handle multiple range sum queries efficiently. \n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The constructor `__init__` takes an integer array `nums` and constructs a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array is built in O(n) time, where n is the length of `nums`. Each element at index `i` in the prefix sum array represents the sum of all elements from the start of `nums` to index `i`.\n\n2. **Sum Range Method**:\n   - The `sumRange` method computes the sum of elements between indices `left` and `right`. If `left` is 0, it simply returns the value at `prefix_sum[right]`. If `left` is greater than 0, it calculates the sum by subtracting `prefix_sum[left - 1]` from `prefix_sum[right]`. This allows us to get the sum in constant time O(1).\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- The initialization takes O(n) time.\n- Each query takes O(1) time.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the prefix sum array.\n\nOverall, this solution is efficient and well-suited for the problem constraints."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a Fenwick Tree to efficiently handle the update and sum range operations. \n\n1. **Fenwick Tree Implementation**:\n   - The `FenwickTree` class is initialized with a size and creates an internal array to store cumulative sums.\n   - The `update` method adjusts the tree when an element in the original array is updated. It takes the index and the difference (delta) and updates the tree accordingly.\n   - The `sum` method computes the cumulative sum up to a given index, and `range_sum` computes the sum between two indices by leveraging the `sum` method.\n\n2. **NumArray Class**:\n   - The `NumArray` class initializes with the input array and populates the Fenwick Tree with the initial values.\n   - The `update` method calculates the difference between the new value and the current value, updates the original array, and then updates the Fenwick Tree.\n   - The `sumRange` method retrieves the sum of elements between the specified indices using the Fenwick Tree.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- Both `update` and `sumRange` operations run in O(log n) time due to the properties of the Fenwick Tree.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the Fenwick Tree, where n is the number of elements in the input array.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the maximum constraints of the problem effectively."

We iterate over all possible lengths of subarrays and for each subarray, we consider each balloon as the last one to burst. The coins collected from bursting that balloon are calculated based on the values of the adjacent balloons (which are now guaranteed to be 1 due to our modification).\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(n^3) because we have three nested loops: one for the length of the subarray, one for the left boundary, and one for the last balloon to burst. The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the DP table used to store intermediate results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible ways to burst the balloons and find the optimal solution efficiently within the given constraints."

We then multiply this number by each prime in the given list to generate new candidates for super ugly numbers. If a new candidate has not been seen before, we add it to both the heap and the set of seen numbers.\n\nThis process continues until we have extracted the nth super ugly number. The use of a heap ensures that we always have access to the smallest number, while the set prevents duplicates from being added to the heap.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log k) because for each of the n super ugly numbers, we may need to perform log k operations to maintain the heap, where k is the number of primes.

        "explanation": "The solution uses a bitmasking technique to efficiently determine if two words share any common letters. Each word is converted into a bitmask where each bit represents whether a particular letter (from 'a' to 'z') is present in the word. This allows us to perform quick checks for common letters using bitwise operations.\n\n1. **Bitmask Creation**: For each word, we create a bitmask by iterating through its characters and setting the corresponding bit in an integer. This is done using the expression `bitmask |= 1 << (ord(char) - ord('a'))`, which shifts a 1 to the position corresponding to the character.\n\n2. **Pair Comparison**: We then compare each pair of words using nested loops. For each pair, we check if their bitmasks share any bits using the expression `bitmasks[i] & bitmasks[j] == 0`. If they do not share any bits, we calculate the product of their lengths and update the maximum product found.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of words. This is due to the nested loops that compare each pair of words. The bitmask operations and length calculations are O(1).\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words, as we store the bitmasks and lengths in separate lists.\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints."

We iterate through the indices of the `result` array, placing elements from the `left` pointer at even indices and elements from the `right` pointer at odd indices.\n\nFinally, we copy the rearranged elements back into the original `nums` array.\n\n### Time Complexity\n- The sorting step takes O(n log n).\n- The rearranging step takes O(n).\nThus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).\n\n### Space Complexity\n- We use an additional array `result` of size O(n) for storing the rearranged elements, which gives us a space complexity of O(n). However, since we are modifying the input array in-place, we can consider the extra space used for the result array as acceptable for this problem.\n\nThis solution meets the requirements of the problem and efficiently produces the desired wiggle sort order."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a modified merge sort algorithm to count the number of range sums that fall within the specified bounds. Here's a breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We create an array `prefix_sums` where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the elements from the start of the `nums` array up to index `i-1`. This allows us to compute any range sum `S(i, j)` as `prefix_sums[j + 1] - prefix_sums[i]`.\n\n2. **Counting Valid Ranges**: For each prefix sum, we count how many previous prefix sums fall within the range defined by the current prefix sum adjusted by `lower` and `upper`. This is done using two pointers (`j` and `k`) that traverse the sorted prefix sums.\n\n3. **Merge Sort**: The `sort_and_count` function recursively sorts the prefix sums while counting valid ranges using the `merge_and_count` function. This ensures that we maintain the sorted order of prefix sums, which is crucial for efficiently counting the valid ranges.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the merge sort process, which is efficient given the constraints (up to 100,000 elements).\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the prefix sums."

The constructor initializes the iterator with a nested list and prepares a stack to manage the elements.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The constructor takes a list of `NestedInteger` objects and pushes them onto a stack in reverse order. This allows us to process the elements in the correct order when we pop from the stack.\n\n2. **hasNext() Method**: This method checks if there are any integers left to return. It continuously pops elements from the stack until it finds an integer or the stack is empty. If it finds a list, it pushes the contents of that list onto the stack for further processing.\n\n3. **next() Method**: This method returns the next integer from the stack. It first checks if there is a next integer available by calling `hasNext()`. If there is, it pops the integer from the stack and returns it.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity for both `next()` and `hasNext()` is O(1) on average, as each integer is processed once. However, in the worst case, if the nested structure is deeply nested, it could take O(n) time to flatten the entire structure.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the total number of integers in the nested list, as we may need to store all of them in the stack.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently flattens the nested list while maintaining the correct order of integers."

This works because a power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.\n3. **Even Position Check**: The condition `n % 3 == 1` is used to determine if the single set bit is in an even position, which is characteristic of powers of four. For example:\n   - \\(4^0 = 1\\) (binary `0001`)\n   - \\(4^1 = 4\\) (binary `0100`)\n   - \\(4^2 = 16\\) (binary `10000`)\n   - \\(4^3 = 64\\) (binary `1000000`)\n   The pattern shows that the only set bit for powers of four appears at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., which corresponds to `n % 3 == 1`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(1) - The solution runs in constant time since it involves a few arithmetic operations and bit manipulation.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) - The solution uses a constant amount of space.\n\nThus, the function efficiently determines if `n` is a power of four without using loops or recursion."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently reverse the vowels in the string. We first create a set of vowels for quick lookup. The string is converted into a list to allow for in-place modifications. \n\n1. We initialize two pointers: `left` starting at the beginning of the list and `right` at the end.\n2. We then enter a loop that continues until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.\n3. Inside the loop, we move the `left` pointer to the right until we find a vowel, and similarly, we move the `right` pointer to the left until we find a vowel.\n4. If both pointers point to valid vowels, we swap them and move both pointers inward.\n5. Finally, we join the list back into a string and return it.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the string at most twice (once for each pointer). The space complexity is O(n) due to the list conversion of the string. This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints."

        "explanation": "The solution begins by sorting the envelopes based on their width and height. The sorting is done using a lambda function that sorts primarily by width in ascending order and secondarily by height in descending order. This ensures that when we look for the longest increasing subsequence of heights, we do not mistakenly include envelopes of the same width.\n\nAfter sorting, we initialize an empty list `dp` that will be used to track the heights of the envelopes in the longest increasing subsequence. For each envelope, we use the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the position where the current height can be inserted in `dp` while maintaining the sorted order. If the height is greater than all existing heights in `dp`, we append it. Otherwise, we replace the existing height at the found index with the current height.\n\nFinally, the length of the `dp` list gives us the maximum number of envelopes that can be Russian dolled.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step and the binary search for each envelope, while the space complexity is O(n) for storing the `dp` list."

For each range defined by `i` and `j`, we consider every possible guess `k` within that range. The cost of guessing `k` is `k` plus the maximum of the costs of the two resulting ranges (if the guess is wrong).\n\n3. **Base Cases**: The base cases are handled implicitly since `dp[i][i]` is `0` (no cost when there's only one number) and `dp[i][i+1]` is `i` (the cost of guessing the first number).\n\n4. **Final Result**: The minimum cost to guarantee a win for the entire range from `1` to `n` is found in `dp[1][n]`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) due to the three nested loops: one for the length of the range, one for the starting point, and one for the guess.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n^2) because of the 2D `dp` array used to store the results.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently computes the required minimum cost using dynamic programming principles."

        "explanation": "The `RandomizedSet` class is designed to support three main operations efficiently:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The constructor initializes an empty list `values` to store the elements and a dictionary `index_map` to map each element to its index in the list.\n\n2. **Insert Operation**: The `insert` method checks if the value already exists in `index_map`. If it does not, it adds the value to `values` and records its index in `index_map`. This operation is O(1) because both the dictionary lookup and list append operations are O(1).\n\n3. **Remove Operation**: The `remove` method checks if the value exists in `index_map`. If it does, it retrieves the index of the value, swaps it with the last element in the list (to maintain the list's structure), and then removes the last element. The index of the last element is updated in `index_map`. This operation is also O(1) due to the constant time complexity of dictionary and list operations.\n\n4. **GetRandom Operation**: The `getRandom` method uses `random.choice()` to return a random element from the `values` list. This is O(1) since it directly accesses an index.\n\nOverall, the time complexity for each operation is O(1) on average, and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the set, due to the storage requirements of the list and dictionary."

We iterate through each character in `magazine` and populate the dictionary with the counts. Then, we iterate through each character in `ransomNote` and check if it exists in the dictionary with a count greater than zero. If it does, we decrement the count in the dictionary to indicate that we have used that character. If we encounter a character in `ransomNote` that is not available in sufficient quantity in `magazine`, we return `False`. If we successfully check all characters in `ransomNote`, we return `True`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of `magazine` and n is the length of `ransomNote`, since we are iterating through both strings once. The space complexity is O(1) in terms of the character count dictionary, as the maximum number of unique characters is limited to 26 (the lowercase English letters)."

This allows the user to reset the array to its initial state.\n\n3. **Shuffle Method (`shuffle`)**: This method implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It iterates from the last index of the array to the first, generating a random index `j` for each index `i`. It then swaps the elements at these indices. This ensures that every permutation of the array is equally likely.\n\n**Time Complexity**:\n- The `reset` method runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array, due to the copying of the array.\n- The `shuffle` method also runs in O(n) time, as it involves a single pass through the array.\n\n**Space Complexity**:\n- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the original array.\n\nOverall, the solution is efficient and meets the problem's requirements effectively."

Otherwise, we append `current` to the result list.\n\n2. **Generating Next Numbers**: We then attempt to generate the next numbers by appending digits (0-9) to the current number. This is done by calculating `next_number = current * 10 + i`. If `next_number` exceeds `n`, we break out of the loop.\n\n3. **Starting the DFS**: We initiate the DFS for each number from 1 to 9. This ensures that we start generating numbers in the correct lexicographical order.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) because we visit each number from 1 to n exactly once.\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for the extra space used, as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size, aside from the output list which is necessary to store the results.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates the required output while adhering to the constraints of the problem."

        "description": "Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:\n\nHere, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.\nIn text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):\n\ndir\n⟶ subdir1\n⟶ ⟶ file1.ext\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1\n⟶ subdir2\n⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2\n⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext\n\nIf we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\". Note that the '\\n' and '\\t' are the new-line and tab characters.\nEvery file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is \"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.\nGiven a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.\nNote that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tfile.ext\"\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is \"dir/subdir2/file.ext\" of length 20.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: input = \"dir\\n\\tsubdir1\\n\\t\\tfile1.ext\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir1\\n\\tsubdir2\\n\\t\\tsubsubdir2\\n\\t\\t\\tfile2.ext\"\nOutput: 32\nExplanation: We have two files:\n\"dir/subdir1/file1.ext\" of length 21\n\"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext\" of length 32.\nWe return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: input = \"a\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named \"a\".\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= input.length <= 104\ninput may contain lowercase or uppercase English letters, a new line character '\\n', a tab character '\\t', a dot '.', a space ' ', and digits.\nAll file and directory names have positive length.\n\n",

        "explanation": "The solution uses a stack-like approach to keep track of the cumulative lengths of paths at different depths in the file system. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:\n\n1. **Input Splitting**: The input string is split into components based on new lines, allowing us to process each directory or file individually.\n2. **Depth Calculation**: For each component, we determine its depth by counting the number of leading tab characters. This helps us understand how deep we are in the directory structure.\n3. **Path Length Management**: We maintain an array `path_lengths` where `path_lengths[i]` holds the total length of the path up to depth `i`. When we encounter a directory, we update this array with the new length. For files, we calculate the total path length by adding the current component's length to the length of the path at its depth.\n4. **Maximum Length Tracking**: Whenever we find a file, we check if its path length is greater than the current maximum and update accordingly.\n5. **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we process each character once.\n6. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(d), where d is the maximum depth of the directory structure, due to the `path_lengths` array.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the maximum constraints of the problem effectively."

If they do not match, we return `False`.\n\nWe then define the expected corners of the bounding rectangle and check if these corners appear exactly once in our corner count. Finally, we ensure that all other corners appear an even number of times. If all conditions are satisfied, we return `True`, indicating that the rectangles form an exact cover of a rectangular region.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of rectangles, as we process each rectangle in constant time. The space complexity is O(1) for the area and bounding rectangle variables, and O(k) for the corner count dictionary, where k is the number of unique corners, which is at most 4 times the number of rectangles."

We iterate through `t` using `t_pointer`, and whenever we find a character in `t` that matches the current character in `s` (pointed by `s_pointer`), we increment `s_pointer`. Regardless of whether there is a match, we always increment `t_pointer` to continue checking the next character in `t`.\n\nThe loop continues until we either match all characters of `s` (i.e., `s_pointer` reaches the length of `s`) or exhaust `t` (i.e., `t_pointer` reaches the length of `t`). If `s_pointer` equals the length of `s` at the end of the loop, it means all characters of `s` were found in `t` in the correct order, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of `t`, since we traverse `t` at most once. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space for the pointers.\n\nFor the follow-up question regarding multiple incoming strings `s1, s2, ..., sk`, we could preprocess `t` to create a mapping of characters to their indices, allowing for faster lookups. This would involve using a dictionary to store the positions of each character in `t`, enabling us to quickly check if each character in `s` can be found in `t` in the correct order."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a recursive approach to find the longest substring where each character appears at least `k` times. The `longestSubstring` method calls a helper function `longest_substring_helper`, which performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the input string `s` is empty, it returns 0.\n2. **Frequency Count**: It counts the frequency of each character in the string using a helper function `count_frequency`.\n3. **Check Frequencies**: It checks if all characters in the frequency dictionary meet the requirement of appearing at least `k` times. If any character does not meet this requirement, the string is split at that character, and the function recursively checks the resulting substrings.\n4. **Return Length**: If all characters meet the requirement, it returns the length of the string.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N^2) in the worst case, where N is the length of the string, due to the recursive calls and the splitting of the string. The space complexity is O(N) for storing the frequency count and the recursive call stack.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently finds the longest valid substring while adhering to the constraints provided."

The BFS is implemented using a queue, where each element in the queue is a tuple containing the current number and the number of steps taken to reach that number.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a queue with the initial number `n` and a step count of 0. We also maintain a set `visited` to keep track of numbers we have already processed to avoid cycles and redundant calculations.\n\n2. **BFS Loop**: We enter a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, we:\n   - Dequeue the front element to get the current number and the number of steps taken.\n   - If the current number is 1, we return the number of steps as the result.\n   - If the current number is even, we calculate the next number by dividing it by 2 and enqueue it if it hasn't been visited.\n   - If the current number is odd, we calculate two possible next numbers (current + 1 and current - 1) and enqueue them if they haven't been visited and are greater than 0.\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(log n) in the average case due to the halving operation for even numbers, but can be higher in the worst case due to the branching factor when dealing with odd numbers.\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the storage of visited numbers and the queue.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to 1."

        "explanation": "The solution constructs a graph where each variable is a node, and the edges represent the division relationships. The `calcEquation` function first builds this graph using a dictionary of dictionaries. Each equation is processed to create two directed edges: one for the direct division and one for the inverse.\n\nThe `dfs` function is a recursive helper that performs a depth-first search to find a path from the start variable to the end variable. If a path is found, it multiplies the weights along the path to compute the result. If no path exists, it returns -1.0.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(V + E) for each query, where V is the number of unique variables and E is the number of equations. Since we can have at most 20 equations and 20 queries, this is efficient. The space complexity is O(V) for storing the graph.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints and provides accurate results for the queries."

This is done while we still have digits left to remove (k > 0).\n\n2. **Building the Result**: After processing all digits, if we still have k digits left to remove, we pop them from the end of the stack. This ensures that we are left with the smallest possible number.\n\n3. **Finalizing the Result**: We join the digits in the stack to form the final number and use `lstrip('0')` to remove any leading zeros. If the result is empty after this operation, we return \"0\".\n\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we process each digit at most twice. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where we might store all digits in the stack."

If this position exists in the set of stones, we recursively call `can_jump` for the next stone and the current jump distance.\n4. **Return Value**: If any of the recursive calls return `True`, we memoize and return `True`. If all possibilities are exhausted without reaching the last stone, we memoize and return `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of stones, due to the nested recursive calls and the potential for each stone to be checked multiple times.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for the memoization dictionary and the set of stones.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently determines if the frog can cross the river by leveraging recursion and memoization."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a single pass through the input array to count the number of arithmetic slices. We start from the third element (index 2) and check if the current element, the previous element, and the one before that form an arithmetic sequence. If they do, we increment the `current` variable, which keeps track of how many new arithmetic slices can be formed by extending the previous slices. Each time we find a valid triplet, we add the value of `current` to `count`, which accumulates the total number of arithmetic slices.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we only make a single pass through the array, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.\n\nIn summary, this approach efficiently counts the number of arithmetic slices by leveraging the properties of arithmetic sequences and maintaining a running count of valid slices."

This automatically filters out any duplicate values, ensuring that we only have unique numbers. We then sort this set in descending order to easily access the maximum values.\n\nNext, we check the length of the sorted list:\n- If it contains fewer than three elements, we return the first element, which is the maximum number.\n- If it contains three or more elements, we return the third element in the sorted list, which corresponds to the third distinct maximum.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of distinct elements. However, since we are only iterating through the list once to create the set, the overall complexity can be considered O(n) for the distinct count. The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage of distinct numbers in the set."

Inside the loop:\n   - We retrieve the current digit from `num1` and `num2` using the pointers. If the pointer is out of bounds (i.e., less than 0), we treat the digit as 0.\n   - We calculate the total of the two digits and the carry. The new carry is determined by integer division of the total by 10, and the digit to append to the result is the remainder of the total when divided by 10.\n\n3. **Building the result**: We append the calculated digit to the `result` list. After processing all digits, we reverse the `result` list since we built it from the least significant to the most significant digit.\n\n4. **Returning the result**: Finally, we join the list into a string and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively.

        "explanation": "The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the grid and determine which cells can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We create two boolean matrices, `pacific_reachable` and `atlantic_reachable`, to track which cells can reach the respective oceans. The dimensions of these matrices match the input grid.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function takes the current cell's coordinates and a reachable matrix. It marks the current cell as reachable and recursively explores its neighbors (up, down, left, right) if they are within bounds, not already marked as reachable, and have a height greater than or equal to the current cell.\n\n3. **Starting Points**: We initiate the DFS from the edges of the grid that are adjacent to the oceans. For the Pacific Ocean, we start from the first row and first column. For the Atlantic Ocean, we start from the last row and last column.\n\n4. **Collecting Results**: After both DFS traversals, we iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of cells that are marked as reachable from both oceans.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited at most once during the DFS.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage of the two boolean matrices and the recursion stack used in the DFS.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the maximum constraints of the problem effectively."

        "explanation": "The solution begins by counting the occurrences of each character in the input string using a dictionary. This allows us to efficiently determine how many times each digit can be formed based on the unique characters associated with them.\n\nWe initialize a list `digit_count` to keep track of how many of each digit (0-9) we can form. We first count the digits that can be uniquely identified by their characters (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and then calculate the counts for the remaining digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) based on the counts of previously identified digits.\n\nFinally, we construct the result string by appending each digit the number of times it was counted, and we return the digits in ascending order.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we traverse the string to count characters and then construct the result. The space complexity is O(1) since the size of the `digit_count` list is constant (10 elements)."

We also maintain an array `count` to keep track of the frequency of each character in the current window and a variable `max_count` to store the count of the most frequently occurring character.\n\n2. **Expanding the Window**: As we iterate through the string with the `right` pointer, we update the count of the current character and check if it is the most frequent character in the window.\n\n3. **Checking Replacement Condition**: If the number of characters that need to be replaced (calculated as the size of the window minus `max_count`) exceeds `k`, we increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The length of the longest valid substring is determined by the size of the window, which is `right - left + 1`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), since the `count` array has a fixed size of 26 (for each uppercase English letter).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the solution while adhering to the constraints provided."

        "description": "Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nisLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nYou don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.\nThe topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.\nThe topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.\nExplanation is shown in the photo below:\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\nn == 2x where 0 <= x <= 6\n\n",

        "explanation": "The provided solution implements a level order traversal of an n-ary tree using a queue. The algorithm starts by checking if the root is `None`, in which case it returns an empty list. It initializes a queue with the root node and enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty.\n\nWithin the loop, the algorithm determines the number of nodes at the current level by checking the size of the queue. It then initializes a list to hold the values of the nodes at that level. For each node at the current level, it dequeues the node, appends its value to the current level list, and enqueues all of its children.\n\nAfter processing all nodes at the current level, the current level list is appended to the result list. This process repeats until all levels of the tree have been processed.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(M), where M is the maximum number of nodes at any level, which can occur in the queue at the same time.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently captures the level order traversal of an n-ary tree."

        "description": "You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.\nGiven the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.\nReturn the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]\nOutput: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]\nExplanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.\nAfter flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: head = [1,2,null,3]\nOutput: [1,3,2]\nExplanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.\nAfter flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: head = []\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There could be empty list in the input.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n \nHow the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:\nWe use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:\n\n 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL\n         |\n         7---8---9---10--NULL\n             |\n             11--12--NULL\nThe serialization of each level is as follows:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]\n[7,8,9,10,null]\n[11,12,null]\n\nTo serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:\n\n[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]\n             |\n[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]\n                   |\n[            null, 11, 12, null]\n\nMerging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:\n\n[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]\n\n",

The algorithm starts by checking if the head is None, in which case it returns None immediately. \n\n1. **Initialization**: A stack is initialized to keep track of nodes that need to be processed. The `current` pointer starts at the head of the list, and `prev` is initialized to None.\n\n2. **Traversal**: The while loop continues until both `current` is None and the stack is empty. Inside the loop:\n   - If `current` is None, it means we need to pop a node from the stack to continue processing.\n   - If `prev` is not None, it links the `prev` node to the `current` node, establishing the doubly linked relationship.\n   - If `current` has a next node, it is pushed onto the stack for later processing.\n   - If `current` has a child, it is also pushed onto the stack, and the child pointer is set to None to avoid any references in the flattened list.\n   - Finally, `prev` is updated to `current`, and `current` moves to the next node.\n\n3. **Return**: After all nodes are processed, the head of the flattened list is returned.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is processed exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the maximum depth of the stack, which corresponds to the maximum depth of the multilevel structure. In the worst case, this could be O(N) if all nodes are in a single child list.\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently flattens the multilevel doubly linked list while maintaining the required order of nodes."

        "explanation": "The provided solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to count the number of paths in a binary tree that sum to a given target. The main function `pathSum` initializes a hashmap to keep track of the cumulative sums encountered during the traversal. \n\n1. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function takes the current node, the cumulative sum up to that node, and the hashmap of prefix sums. It checks if the difference between the current sum and the target sum exists in the hashmap, which indicates that there are paths that sum to the target.\n\n2. **Updating Prefix Sums**: As we traverse the tree, we update the hashmap with the current path sum. After exploring both left and right children, we backtrack by decrementing the count of the current path sum in the hashmap to ensure that we do not count the same path multiple times.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack and the hashmap storing the prefix sums.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently counts the number of valid paths in the binary tree that sum to the target value."

We then create a frequency count for `p` and the first window of `s`.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We iterate through `s` starting from the end of the first window. For each new character that enters the window, we update the frequency count. We also decrement the count of the character that is sliding out of the window. If the count of any character drops to zero, we remove it from the frequency count to keep the comparison efficient.\n\n3. **Comparison**: After updating the frequency counts, we check if they are equal. If they are, it means the current window is an anagram of `p`, and we record the starting index.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of `s`, since we make a single pass through `s` and perform constant-time operations for each character.\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because the frequency count only needs to store counts for 26 lowercase English letters, which is a constant size.\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints."

For each anchor point, it calculates the squared distance to every other point and counts how many times each distance occurs using a dictionary. \n\n1. **Distance Calculation**: The squared distance is calculated to avoid the computational cost and potential inaccuracies of square roots. The formula used is `(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2`.\n\n2. **Counting Distances**: For each anchor point, we maintain a count of how many points are at each unique distance. This is done using a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.\n\n3. **Calculating Boomerangs**: For each unique distance, if there are `count` points at that distance, the number of ways to select two points (j and k) from these `count` points is `count * (count - 1)`. This accounts for the order of selection, which is crucial for counting boomerangs.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because for each of the n points, we are iterating through the n points again to calculate distances. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case for the distance count dictionary.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently counts the number of boomerangs in the given set of points."

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the count.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of content children by always trying to satisfy the least greedy child with the smallest available cookie that meets their needs."

We iterate through the list from the last element to the first. For each element `nums[i]`, we check if it is less than `third`. If it is, we have found a valid 132 pattern (nums[i] as '1', `third` as '3', and the last popped value from the stack as '2').\n3. If `nums[i]` is not less than `third`, we pop elements from the stack while they are less than or equal to `nums[i]`, updating `third` to the last popped value. This ensures that `third` always holds the largest possible value for '3' that can form a valid pattern with the current '1'.\n4. Finally, we push `nums[i]` onto the stack for future comparisons.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) because each element is processed at most twice (once pushed and once popped from the stack). The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all elements are pushed onto the stack.\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a string manipulation technique to determine if the input string can be constructed by repeating a substring. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Concatenation**: We create a new string by concatenating the input string `s` with itself. This results in `doubled_s = s + s`.\n\n2. **Substring Check**: We then check if the original string `s` exists within the substring of `doubled_s` that excludes the first and last characters. This is done using the expression `doubled_s[1:-1]`.\n\n3. **Return Value**: If `s` is found in this modified string, it indicates that `s` can be formed by repeating a substring, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because the concatenation and substring search operations are linear with respect to the length of the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the `doubled_s` string, which is twice the length of the original string.\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging string properties to solve the problem effectively."

For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.\n\nTo determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation).

For each integer, it checks if it has been used (using a bitmask).\n   - If the integer has not been used, it simulates choosing that integer and calls `canWin` recursively with the updated total and the updated bitmask.\n   - If the second player cannot win after the first player's move, it means the first player can force a win, and we return `True`.\n\n3. **Memoization**:\n   - We store results in a dictionary `memo` to avoid recalculating results for the same state, which significantly improves efficiency.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(2^n) in the worst case due to the recursive exploration of all subsets of integers, where n is `maxChoosableInteger`. However, memoization reduces the number of states we need to evaluate.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for the memoization dictionary and the recursion stack.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently determines if the first player can guarantee a win given optimal play from both players."

        "explanation": "The solution consists of two helper functions: `is_valid_ipv4` and `is_valid_ipv6`, which validate the respective IP formats.\n\n1. **IPv4 Validation**:\n   - The input string is split by '.' into parts. If there are not exactly 4 parts, it returns `False`.\n   - Each part is checked to ensure it is a digit and within the range of 0 to 255. Additionally, it checks for leading zeros.\n\n2. **IPv6 Validation**:\n   - The input string is split by ':' into parts. If there are not exactly 8 parts, it returns `False`.\n   - Each part is checked to ensure its length is between 1 and 4 and that it contains only valid hexadecimal characters.\n\n3. The main function first checks if the input is a valid IPv4 address. If so, it returns \"IPv4\". If not, it checks for IPv6 validity and returns \"IPv6\" if valid. If neither check passes, it returns \"Neither\".\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we may need to traverse the entire string to validate it.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for variables and do not use any additional data structures that grow with input size."

        "explanation": "The solution uses the `rand7()` function to generate random numbers in a controlled manner to achieve the desired output of `rand10()`. \n\n1. **Generating a number from 1 to 49**: By calling `rand7()` twice, we create a number in the range [1, 49]. The formula `(a - 1) * 7 + b` effectively maps the two calls into a single number.\n\n2. **Filtering for uniformity**: We only accept numbers from 1 to 40. This is because 40 is the largest multiple of 10 that fits within our generated range of 49. By discarding numbers greater than 40, we ensure that each of the numbers from 1 to 40 can be evenly divided into 10 groups, allowing us to map them uniformly to the range [1, 10].\n\n3. **Expected number of calls to rand7()**: The expected number of calls to `rand7()` can be calculated based on the probability of generating a valid number. Since we discard numbers greater than 40, the probability of success is 40/49. Therefore, the expected number of calls to `rand7()` is approximately 49/40, which is about 1.225 calls on average.\n\n4. **Time and Space Complexity**: The time complexity is O(1) on average, as we expect to generate a valid number in a constant number of iterations. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates a random integer in the desired range while adhering to the constraints of the problem."

If adding a matchstick exceeds the target length for that side, it backtracks and tries the next side.\n\n5. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are used and all sides are equal to the target length, we return true.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(4^n) in the worst case, where n is the number of matchsticks, due to the backtracking nature of the solution. However, the sorting step takes O(n log n).\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) for the sides array, and O(n) for the recursion stack in the worst case.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks if the matchsticks can form a square while adhering to the constraints provided."

For larger values of \\(n\\), we calculate the upper and lower limits for n-digit integers.\n\nWe then generate palindromic numbers by iterating from the largest n-digit integer downwards. For each integer \\(i\\), we create a palindrome by concatenating \\(i\\) with its reverse. \n\nNext, we check if this palindrome can be expressed as a product of two n-digit integers. We do this by iterating through potential factors \\(j\\) from the upper limit downwards. If \\(j\\) is a factor of the palindrome, we compute the other factor and check if it lies within the n-digit range.\n\nThe first valid palindrome we find is returned modulo 1337. The time complexity of this approach is approximately \\(O(n^2)\\) in the worst case, as we may need to check multiple palindromes and their factors. The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) since we are using a constant amount of space for variables.\n\nOverall, this method efficiently finds the largest palindromic product of two n-digit integers while adhering to the constraints provided."

The current character at the `index` tells us how many times to append the next character (which alternates between '1' and '2').\n3. **Counting '1's**: Each time we append '1', we increment our count of '1's.\n4. **Termination**: The loop stops once we have generated at least `n` characters, and we return the count of '1's.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We generate the magical string up to `n` characters, and each character is processed a constant number of times.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(n) - We store the magical string in a list, which can grow up to `n` characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of '1's in the magical string without unnecessary computations or storage."

This is done to simplify the formatting process. \n\nNext, we calculate the length of the first group. If the total length of the string (after removing dashes) is divisible by `k`, the first group will have a length of `k`. Otherwise, it will have a length equal to the remainder of the total length divided by `k`. This is handled by the expression `n % k or k`, which ensures that if `n % k` is zero, we still set the first group length to `k`.\n\nWe then initialize a list called `result` with the first group of characters. After that, we iterate through the string in steps of `k`, appending each subsequent group to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, we join all the groups in the `result` list with dashes and return the formatted string.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we traverse the string a constant number of times (removing dashes, converting to uppercase, and grouping).\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of the result list, which can potentially hold all characters of the input string in the worst case."

For each subarray defined by indices `i` and `j`, we calculate the maximum score difference based on the two choices Player 1 has:\n   - Picking the left end (`nums[i]`), which gives a score of `nums[i]` minus the optimal score Player 2 can achieve from the remaining subarray.\n   - Picking the right end (`nums[j]`), which gives a score of `nums[j]` minus the optimal score Player 2 can achieve from the remaining subarray.\n\n3. **Final Decision**: After filling the DP table, we check the value of `dp[0][n-1]`. If it is non-negative, it means Player 1 can win or tie, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the nested loops filling the DP table.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the DP table."

        "description": "You are playing a variation of the game Zuma.\nIn this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.\nYour goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:\n\nPick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.\nIf there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.\n\t\nIf this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.\n\n\nIf there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.\nRepeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.\n\nGiven a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = \"WRRBBW\", hand = \"RB\"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:\n- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.\n- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.\nThere are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = \"WWRRBBWW\", hand = \"WRBRW\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: To make the board empty:\n- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.\n- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.\n2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: board = \"G\", hand = \"GGGGG\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: To make the board empty:\n- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG.\n- Insert 'G' so the board becomes GGG. GGG -> empty.\n2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= board.length <= 16\n1 <= hand.length <= 5\nboard and hand consist of the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.\nThe initial row of balls on the board will not have any groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.\n\n",

        "explanation": "The solution uses a modified merge sort algorithm to count the number of reverse pairs in the array. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Merge Sort**: The `merge_sort_and_count` function recursively divides the array into halves until it reaches single elements. It then merges these halves back together while counting reverse pairs.\n\n2. **Counting Reverse Pairs**: In the `merge_and_count` function, for each element in the left half of the array, we check how many elements in the right half are less than half of that element. This is done using a two-pointer technique, which efficiently counts the valid pairs.\n\n3. **Merging**: After counting the reverse pairs, we merge the two halves back into a temporary array and then copy the sorted elements back into the original array.\n\nThe overall time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the merge sort, and the space complexity is O(n) for the temporary array used during merging. This makes the solution efficient and suitable for the input constraints."

        "explanation": "The solution involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: In the `__init__` method, we calculate the area of each rectangle and maintain a prefix sum array that allows us to quickly determine the cumulative area up to each rectangle. This helps in efficiently selecting a rectangle based on a random number.\n\n2. **Random Point Selection**: The `pick` method generates a random integer within the total area of all rectangles. It then uses binary search on the prefix sum array to find out which rectangle corresponds to this random number. \n\n3. **Point Generation**: Once the rectangle is identified, we generate a random integer for both x and y coordinates within the bounds of that rectangle. The `random.randint(a, x)` function ensures that the point can be on the perimeter as well.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The initialization takes O(n) time to compute areas and prefix sums, where n is the number of rectangles. The `pick` method runs in O(log n) time due to the binary search, making it efficient for multiple calls.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the prefix sums.\n\nThis approach is efficient and meets the problem's constraints, allowing for up to 10,000 calls to `pick` without performance issues."

If the count matches `max_count`, we append the value to the `modes` list.\n\n2. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) because we visit each node exactly once.\n\n3. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(h) due to the recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree. The additional space used for the `count` dictionary and the `modes` list is considered negligible in terms of the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds all modes in the BST while adhering to the constraints provided."

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.\nYou are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.\nInitially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\nPick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]\nOutput: 6\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 105\n0 <= w <= 109\nn == profits.length\nn == capital.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n0 <= profits[i] <= 104\n0 <= capital[i] <= 109\n\n",

        "explanation": "The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of combinations that can form a given amount using an infinite supply of coins of specified denominations. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We create a list `dp` of size `amount + 1` initialized to zero, except for `dp[0]`, which is set to 1. This represents the base case where there is one way to make the amount 0 (by using no coins).\n\n2. **Filling the DP Array**: For each coin, we iterate through all possible amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount. For each amount `j`, we update `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - coin]`. This means that if we include the current coin, the number of ways to make `j` increases by the number of ways to make `j - coin`.\n\n3. **Final Output**: After processing all coins, `dp[amount]` contains the total number of combinations to make the target amount.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n * amount), where n is the number of coins. This is because we iterate through each coin and for each coin, we iterate through the amounts from the coin's value to the target amount.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(amount), as we only need a single array of size `amount + 1` to store the number of combinations for each amount.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the upper limits of the problem constraints effectively."

For example, if the input weights are `[1, 3]`, the prefix sum will be `[1, 4]`. This means that the first index (0) corresponds to a cumulative weight of 1, and the second index (1) corresponds to a cumulative weight of 4.\n\n2. **Random Index Picking**:\n   - In the `pickIndex` method, we generate a random integer between `1` and the total sum of weights. We then perform a binary search on the prefix sum array to find the smallest index where the prefix sum is greater than or equal to the random number. This index is returned as the result.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**:\n   - The initialization of the prefix sum array takes O(n), where n is the length of the weights array.\n   - Each call to `pickIndex` takes O(log n) due to the binary search.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**:\n   - The space complexity is O(n) for storing the prefix sum array.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the requirements of the problem while ensuring that the selection of indices is based on the specified weights."

The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Counting Occurrences**: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to create a frequency map of the numbers in `nums`. This allows us to quickly check how many times each number appears.\n\n2. **Finding Unique Pairs**:\n   - If `k` is greater than 0, we iterate through each unique number in the frequency map and check if the number plus `k` exists in the map. If it does, we increment our count of unique pairs.\n   - If `k` is 0, we check how many numbers have a count greater than 1, as these can form pairs with themselves.\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`, since we traverse the list to count occurrences and then check for pairs in a single pass through the unique numbers.\n\n4. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the storage of the frequency map.\n\nThis efficient approach ensures that we can handle the upper limits of the input constraints effectively."

If the node is not null, we:\n   - Recursively call `reverse_inorder` on the right child (to process greater values first).\n   - Update the `running_sum` by adding the current node's value to it.\n   - Set the current node's value to the updated `running_sum`.\n   - Finally, we recursively call `reverse_inorder` on the left child.\n\n3. **Return the Modified Tree**: After the traversal is complete, we return the modified root of the tree.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used during the traversal. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently converts the BST to a Greater Tree while maintaining the properties of the original tree structure."

This is because we are primarily iterating through the list to construct the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is also O(n) due to the string construction, which requires space proportional to the number of elements in `nums`.\n\nOverall, this solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of division to achieve the desired result."

Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\nisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n    public boolean isLeaf;\n    public Node topLeft;\n    public Node topRight;\n    public Node bottomLeft;\n    public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.\nQuad-Tree format:\nThe input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n \nExample 1:\n \n\nInput: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]\n, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nOutput: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above.

This allows us to build the resulting Quad-Tree from the merged results of the quadrants.\n3. **Merging Logic**: After merging the children, if all four children are leaves and have the same value, we can simplify the result to a single leaf node. Otherwise, we return a new internal node with the merged children.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the Quad-Trees. In the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the Quad-Tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, this can be O(log n) for balanced trees, but can be O(n) for skewed trees."

        "explanation": "The solution uses the sliding window technique combined with character frequency counting to efficiently determine if s2 contains a permutation of s1. \n\n1. **Character Counting**: We use the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of characters in both s1 and the current window of s2. This allows us to easily compare the two counts.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We initialize the window with the first `len(s1)` characters of s2. As we slide the window one character at a time, we update the character counts by adding the new character that enters the window and removing the character that exits.\n\n3. **Comparison**: After each update, we check if the character counts of the current window match those of s1. If they do, we return `True`. If we finish sliding through s2 without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of s2, since we traverse s2 once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed-size array for character counts (26 lowercase letters).\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints."

This takes O(n) time.\n\n2. **Finding Min and Max**: We then calculate the minimum and maximum values within the identified unsorted subarray. This is also done in O(n) time.\n\n3. **Expanding Boundaries**: We check if we need to expand the left and right boundaries based on the min and max values found. This ensures that we include any elements that are out of order but are outside the initially identified boundaries.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The length of the unsorted subarray is calculated as `right - left + 1`.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space. This makes the solution efficient and suitable for the input constraints provided."

If the characters match, we increment the LCS length from the previous indices. If they do not match, we take the maximum LCS length possible by either ignoring the current character of `word1` or `word2`.\n\n3. **Calculating Minimum Deletions**: Once we have the length of the LCS, the minimum number of deletions required to make the two strings the same is calculated using the formula mentioned earlier.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \\(O(m \\times n)\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. This is due to the nested loops filling the DP table.\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(m \\times n)\\) for the DP table. However, it can be optimized to \\(O(\\min(m, n))\\) by using only two rows of the DP table at a time."

If adding a new point would create a clockwise turn (indicating that the last two points in the hull and the new point do not form a convex shape), the last point is removed.\n   - The upper hull is constructed similarly but iterates through the points in reverse order.\n\n4. **Combining Hulls**: Finally, the unique points from both the lower and upper hulls are combined to form the final list of points that are on the perimeter of the fence.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, while the hull construction takes O(n).\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the points in the hulls.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the points that need to be included in the fence, ensuring that all trees are enclosed with the minimum length of rope."

Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters.

        "title": "Construct String from Binary Tree",
        "description": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n\nNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\n\nParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\nIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\nIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n\n\n\nOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: \"1(2(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be \"1(2(4))(3)\".\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: \"1(2()(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n",

This handles the case where we reach a leaf node's child.\n2. **Node Value**: We convert the current node's value to a string and store it in `result`.\n3. **Left Child**: If the node has a left child, we recursively call `tree2str` on the left child and append its result in parentheses to `result`.\n4. **Right Child**: If the node has a right child, we check if the left child is absent. If it is, we append an empty pair of parentheses `()` to indicate the absence of the left child. Then, we recursively call `tree2str` on the right child and append its result in parentheses.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), this could be O(N), but in a balanced tree, it would be O(log N).\n\nOverall, this solution efficiently constructs the required string representation of the binary tree while adhering to the specified formatting rules."

The pointer `k` starts from `i + 2` and moves right until the condition fails. The number of valid triangles that can be formed with the sides nums[i] and nums[j] is given by the count of indices from `j + 1` to `k - 1`, which is `k - j - 1`.\n\nThe overall time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of valid triangle triplets in the input array."

        "explanation": "The solution uses a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks while respecting the cooling interval. \n\n1. **Counting Frequencies**: We utilize the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each task appears in the input list. This allows us to easily find the task with the maximum frequency.\n\n2. **Finding Maximum Frequency**: We determine the maximum frequency of any task, which is crucial for calculating the required idle slots.\n\n3. **Calculating Idle Slots**: The formula `(max_freq - 1) * (n + 1)` calculates the total number of slots needed to accommodate the most frequent task while ensuring that there are `n` intervals between repetitions of that task. We then add `max_count`, which is the number of tasks that have this maximum frequency, to account for the last occurrences of these tasks.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is the maximum of the total calculated slots and the length of the tasks list. This ensures that if there are enough tasks to fill the slots, we return the number of tasks; otherwise, we return the calculated minimum intervals.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where m is the number of unique tasks and n is the length of the tasks list. This is because we need to count the tasks and then perform a few constant-time operations.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique tasks, due to the storage of the task counts."
