    "title": "Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree",
    "description": "One way to serialize a binary tree is to use preorder traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as '#'.\n\nFor example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string \"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#\", where '#' represents a null node.\nGiven a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.\nIt is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.\nYou may assume that the input format is always valid.\n\nFor example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as \"1,,3\".\n\nNote: You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: preorder = \"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#\"\nOutput: true\nExample 2:\nInput: preorder = \"1,#\"\nOutput: false\nExample 3:\nInput: preorder = \"9,#,#,1\"\nOutput: false\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= preorder.length <= 104\npreorder consist of integers in the range [0, 100] and '#' separated by commas ','.\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution uses a greedy approach to validate the preorder serialization of a binary tree. We start with one available slot for the root node. As we iterate through each node in the serialized string:\n\n1. We decrement the slot count for each node we process.\n2. If the node is a non-null value (not '#'), we add two slots for its children.\n3. If the node is a null value ('#'), we do not add any slots.\n4. If at any point the slots become negative, it indicates that we have more nodes than we can accommodate, and we return `False`.\n5. Finally, we check if we have exactly zero slots left, which indicates a valid serialization.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the input string, as we process each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the slot counter."
