    "explanation": "The solution uses an in-order traversal of the binary search tree (BST) to find the kth smallest element. The in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order, which is a key property of BSTs. \n\n1. **In-order Traversal**: The function `in_order_traversal` is defined to recursively visit the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child. This ensures that we visit nodes in sorted order.\n\n2. **Counting Nodes**: A counter (`self.count`) is used to keep track of how many nodes have been visited. When this counter equals `k`, we store the current node's value in `self.kth_value`.\n\n3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when a null node is reached, ensuring that we do not attempt to access properties of non-existent nodes.\n\n4. **Return Value**: After the traversal, the value of `self.kth_value` is returned, which holds the kth smallest value.\n\n**Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(H + k), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), this can be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it is O(log n).\n\n**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H) due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this can also be O(n) for a skewed tree.\n\nThis approach is efficient and straightforward for finding the kth smallest element in a BST."
