    "description": "A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:\n\nThe string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.\n\nThe first few elements of s is s = \"1221121221221121122……\". If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be \"1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......\" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are \"1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......\". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.\nGiven an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is \"122112\" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution constructs the magical string iteratively based on the rules provided. \n\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the magical string containing just the first character '1' and initialize a count for '1's.\n2. **Looping**: We use a while loop to continue generating characters until the length of the magical string reaches `n`. The current character at the `index` tells us how many times to append the next character (which alternates between '1' and '2').\n3. **Counting '1's**: Each time we append '1', we increment our count of '1's.\n4. **Termination**: The loop stops once we have generated at least `n` characters, and we return the count of '1's.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) - We generate the magical string up to `n` characters, and each character is processed a constant number of times.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(n) - We store the magical string in a list, which can grow up to `n` characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the number of '1's in the magical string without unnecessary computations or storage."
