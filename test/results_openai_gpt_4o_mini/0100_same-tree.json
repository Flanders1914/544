    "explanation": "The solution uses a recursive function to compare two binary trees. The base cases check if both nodes are `None`, in which case the trees are the same, or if one of the nodes is `None` or their values differ, in which case the trees are not the same. If neither of these conditions is met, the function recursively checks the left and right children of both nodes.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the trees. In the worst case, we may need to visit every node in both trees.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height could be N, but for a balanced tree, it would be log(N).\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently checks for tree equality by leveraging the properties of binary trees and recursion."
