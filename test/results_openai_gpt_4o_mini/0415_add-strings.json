    "explanation": "The solution implements a manual addition of two numbers represented as strings. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to point to the last characters of `num1` and `num2`, respectively. We also initialize a `carry` variable to 0 and an empty list `result` to store the digits of the sum.\n\n2. **Looping through digits**: We use a while loop that continues until all digits from both strings have been processed and there is no carry left. Inside the loop:\n   - We retrieve the current digit from `num1` and `num2` using the pointers. If the pointer is out of bounds (i.e., less than 0), we treat the digit as 0.\n   - We calculate the total of the two digits and the carry. The new carry is determined by integer division of the total by 10, and the digit to append to the result is the remainder of the total when divided by 10.\n\n3. **Building the result**: We append the calculated digit to the `result` list. After processing all digits, we reverse the `result` list since we built it from the least significant to the most significant digit.\n\n4. **Returning the result**: Finally, we join the list into a string and return it.\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively. We process each digit once.\n\n**Space Complexity**: O(max(n, m)), for storing the result in the list before converting it to a string.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the addition of large numbers represented as strings without any direct integer conversion."
