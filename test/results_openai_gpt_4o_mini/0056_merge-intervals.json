    "explanation": "The solution begins by sorting the input list of intervals based on their starting points. This is crucial because it allows us to efficiently check for overlaps as we iterate through the list.\n\n1. **Sorting**: The sorting step uses Python's built-in sort function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). After sorting, the intervals are arranged in a way that any overlapping intervals will be adjacent to each other.\n\n2. **Merging**: We initialize an empty list called `merged` to store the merged intervals. We then loop through each interval in the sorted list:\n   - If `merged` is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last merged interval (i.e., the end of the last merged interval is less than the start of the current interval), we simply append the current interval to `merged`.\n   - If there is an overlap, we merge the current interval with the last one by updating the end of the last merged interval to be the maximum of the two ends.\n\n3. **Returning the Result**: After processing all intervals, we return the `merged` list, which contains all the non-overlapping intervals.\n\nThe overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all intervals are non-overlapping and need to be stored in the `merged` list."
