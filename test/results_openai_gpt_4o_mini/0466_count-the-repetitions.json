You have the two strings str1 = [s1, n1] and str2 = [s2, n2].\nReturn the maximum integer m such that str = [str2, m] can be obtained from str1.\n \nExample 1:\nInput: s1 = \"acb\", n1 = 4, s2 = \"ab\", n2 = 2\nOutput: 2\nExample 2:\nInput: s1 = \"acb\", n1 = 1, s2 = \"acb\", n2 = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100\ns1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n1 <= n1, n2 <= 106\n\n",

    "explanation": "The solution uses a nested loop to iterate through the characters of `s1` and `s2`. The outer loop runs `n1` times, simulating the repetition of `s1`. The inner loop goes through each character of `s1`, checking if it matches the current character of `s2`. If a match is found, we move the pointer for `s2` forward. When we reach the end of `s2`, we increment our count of how many times we have fully matched `s2` and reset the pointer for `s2`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n1 * len(s1) + count_s2 * len(s2)), where `count_s2` is the number of times `s2` can be formed from `s1`. In the worst case, this can be O(n1 * len(s1)), but since we are not constructing the strings, this is efficient given the constraints.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space for the indices and counters.\n\nOverall, this approach efficiently counts the maximum repetitions of `s2` that can be formed from `s1` without constructing large strings, making it suitable for the given constraints."
