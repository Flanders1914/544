    "explanation": "The solution uses a string manipulation technique to determine if the input string can be constructed by repeating a substring. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Concatenation**: We create a new string by concatenating the input string `s` with itself. This results in `doubled_s = s + s`.\n\n2. **Substring Check**: We then check if the original string `s` exists within the substring of `doubled_s` that excludes the first and last characters. This is done using the expression `doubled_s[1:-1]`.\n\n3. **Return Value**: If `s` is found in this modified string, it indicates that `s` can be formed by repeating a substring, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because the concatenation and substring search operations are linear with respect to the length of the string.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the `doubled_s` string, which is twice the length of the original string.\n\nOverall, this approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging string properties to solve the problem effectively."
