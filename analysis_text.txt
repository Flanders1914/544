1. **High-Level Breakdown**:
   - **Input Handling**: A component to read and validate the input string.
   - **Palindrome Check**: A utility function to determine if a given substring is a palindrome.
   - **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: A component to initialize and maintain a table for minimum cuts.
   - **Cut Calculation**: A function that uses the palindrome check and the dynamic programming table to compute the minimum cuts needed.
   - **Output Handling**: A component to format and return the result.

2. **Justification for Structure**:
   - Each component has a distinct responsibility, which adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. This separation allows for independent development and testing of each part, making the overall system more robust and easier to manage.
   - The palindrome check is a reusable utility that can be used in various contexts, not just for this specific problem.
   - The dynamic programming approach is encapsulated in its own function, allowing for clear logic flow and easier debugging.

3. **Function Classification**:
   - **Auxiliary Functions**:
     - `is_palindrome(substring: str) -> bool`: Checks if a given substring is a palindrome.
     - `initialize_dp_table(length: int) -> List[int]`: Initializes the dynamic programming table for minimum cuts.
   - **Main Function**:
     - `min_cut_palindrome_partition(s: str) -> int`: This function orchestrates the execution of auxiliary functions to compute the minimum cuts needed for palindrome partitioning. It takes the input string `s` and returns the minimum number of cuts.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The input string consists only of lowercase English letters, as specified in the constraints.
   - The length of the string will not exceed 2000 characters, allowing for efficient use of dynamic programming without performance concerns.

5. **Component Interaction**:
   - The `min_cut_palindrome_partition` function will first call `initialize_dp_table` to set up the necessary data structures. It will then iterate through the string, using `is_palindrome` to check each substring. Based on the results, it will update the dynamic programming table to reflect the minimum cuts needed. Finally, it will return the result, which can be formatted by the output handling component.
