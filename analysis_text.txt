1. **High-Level Breakdown of the Task:**
   - **Input Handling:** A component to receive and validate the input string.
   - **Palindrome Check:** A utility to determine if a given substring is a palindrome.
   - **Dynamic Programming Table Setup:** A component to initialize and maintain a table for minimum cuts.
   - **Cut Calculation:** A component that uses the palindrome check and the dynamic programming table to compute the minimum cuts needed.
   - **Output Handling:** A component to format and return the result.

2. **Justification for Structure:**
   - The task is divided into logical components that each handle a specific part of the problem. This separation allows for independent development and testing of each component, which is crucial for complex problems like this. For instance, the palindrome check can be reused in different contexts, and the dynamic programming logic can be tested separately from input/output handling.

3. **Identification and Classification of Functions:**
   - **Auxiliary Functions:**
     - `is_palindrome(substring: str) -> bool`: Checks if a given substring is a palindrome.
     - `initialize_dp_table(length: int) -> List[int]`: Initializes the dynamic programming table for minimum cuts.
   - **Main Function:**
     - `min_cut_palindrome_partition(s: str) -> int`: This function orchestrates the execution of the auxiliary functions to compute the minimum cuts needed for palindrome partitioning. It takes the input string `s` and returns the minimum number of cuts.

4. **Assumptions:**
   - The input string consists only of lowercase English letters, as specified in the constraints.
   - The length of the string will not exceed 2000 characters, allowing for efficient dynamic programming solutions.

5. **Summary of Component Interaction:**
   - The user invokes the `min_cut_palindrome_partition` function with the input string. This function first initializes the dynamic programming table using `initialize_dp_table`. It then iterates through the string, using `is_palindrome` to check each substring and update the table with the minimum cuts required. Finally, it returns the result, which is the minimum cuts needed for the entire string.
