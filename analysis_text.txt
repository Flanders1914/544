1. **Task Summary**: The task is to partition a string into palindromic substrings with the minimum number of cuts. The output should be the minimum cuts required for such a partitioning.

2. **High-Level Breakdown**:
   - **Input Handling**: Function to accept the input string.
   - **Palindrome Check**: Function to determine if a substring is a palindrome.
   - **Dynamic Programming Table Setup**: Function to initialize and maintain a DP table for minimum cuts.
   - **Cut Calculation**: Function to calculate the minimum cuts needed based on the DP table.
   - **Output Handling**: Function to return the result.

3. **Justification for Structure**: 
   - The breakdown into these components allows for clear separation of concerns. Each function has a specific responsibility, making the code easier to maintain and test. The palindrome check can be reused across different parts of the algorithm, while the DP table setup and cut calculation are logically distinct steps in the overall process.

4. **Function Classification**:
   - **Auxiliary Functions**:
     - `is_palindrome(substring: str) -> bool`: Checks if a given substring is a palindrome.
     - `initialize_dp_table(length: int) -> List[int]`: Initializes the DP table for minimum cuts.
   - **Main Function**:
     - `min_cut_palindrome_partition(s: str) -> int`: This function orchestrates the execution of the auxiliary functions, calculates the minimum cuts, and returns the result. It takes the input string `s` and returns the minimum number of cuts needed.

5. **Assumptions**:
   - The input string consists only of lowercase English letters.
   - The function will handle edge cases, such as empty strings or strings that are already palindromes.

6. **Component Interaction**: 
   - The `min_cut_palindrome_partition` function will first call `initialize_dp_table` to set up the necessary data structures. It will then iterate through the string, using `is_palindrome` to check for palindromic substrings and update the DP table accordingly. Finally, it will return the value from the DP table that represents the minimum cuts needed for the entire string.
