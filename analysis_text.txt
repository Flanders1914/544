1. **Task Summary**: The task is to determine the minimum number of cuts needed to partition a string into substrings that are all palindromes. This involves checking various substrings of the input string and determining if they are palindromic.

2. **High-Level Breakdown**:
   - **Input Handling**: Function to accept the input string.
   - **Palindrome Check**: Function to check if a given substring is a palindrome.
   - **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Function to set up a DP table to store the minimum cuts needed for each substring.
   - **Main Logic**: Function to compute the minimum cuts using the DP table and the palindrome check.

3. **Justification for Structure**: The task is divided into these components to promote modularity and reusability. Each function can be developed and tested independently, which simplifies debugging and enhances maintainability. The palindrome check is a fundamental operation that can be reused across different parts of the program.

4. **Function Classification**:
   - **Auxiliary Functions**:
     - `is_palindrome(s: str, start: int, end: int) -> bool`: Checks if the substring from `start` to `end` is a palindrome.
     - `min_cut_dp(s: str) -> int`: Implements the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cuts.
   - **Main Function**:
     - `min_palindrome_cuts(s: str) -> int`: This is the entry point of the program that orchestrates the execution of the auxiliary functions to return the minimum cuts.

5. **Assumptions**: It is assumed that the input string will always be valid and consist only of lowercase English letters. The algorithm will handle edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings.

6. **Component Interaction**: The main function `min_palindrome_cuts` will call the `min_cut_dp` function, which in turn will utilize the `is_palindrome` function to check for palindromic substrings while filling the DP table. The final result will be derived from the DP table, indicating the minimum cuts needed.
